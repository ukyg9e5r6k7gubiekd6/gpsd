<h1 align='center'><code>gpsd</code> &mdash; a GPS service daemon</h1>

<p><code>gpsd</code> is a service daemon that monitors a GPS attached
to a host computer through a serial or USB port, making its data on
the location/course/velocity of the sensor available to be queried on
TCP port 2947 of the host computer.  With <code>gpsd</code>, multiple
GPS client applications (such as navigational and wardriving software)
can share access to a GPS without contention or loss of data. Also,
gpsd responds to queries with a format that is substantially easier to
parse than the NMEA 0183 emitted by most GPSes.  The <code>gpsd</code>
distribution includes a linkable C service library and/or a Python
module that developers of <code>gpsd</code>-aware applications can use
to encapsulate all communication with <code>gpsd</code>.</para>

<p>The goal of the <code>gpsd</code> project is to create a solid layer of
open-source infrastructure for programs that want to be
location-sensitive. We aim for simple, robust interfaces, unfussy
operation, and an easy learning curve for application developers.
Applications that presently use <code>gpsd</code> include
<a href="http://www.pygps.org">pyGPS</a>,
<a href="http://www.kismetwireless.net/">Kismet</a>, 
<a href="http://www.gpsdrive.cc/">GPSdrive</a>, and 
<a href="http://qpegps.sourceforge.net/">gpeGPS</a>.</p>

<p>Note: As of mid-October 2004, Kismet is currently not working well
with <code>gpsd</code>.  The symptom is a "Lost GPS signal" shortly
after kismet startup.  There is a workaround, which is to run 
<code>gpsd</code> with the -n option.  GPS interface code that works
with both old and new <code>gpsd</code> is already in the development branch of
Kismet and is intended to go into a future mainline release.</p>

<p>We have a <a href='hardware.html'>list of compatible GPSses</a>
with some technical information.  We also have <a href='NMEA.txt'>a
list of NMEA sentences</a>.</p>

<code>gpsd</code> is about, you might find <a

<h1>Code and community</h1>

<p>Look in the <a
href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2116">download</a>
directory for tarballs of all released versions. Access to the
bleeding-edge developer version is supported <a
href="http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=2116">via
Subversion</a>.  The main project page is <a
href='http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gpsd/'>here</a>.</p>

<p>There are three project mailing lists:</p>

<ul>
<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-announce">gpsd-announce</a>
is for release announcements and project news.</p></li>
<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-users">gpsd-users</a>
is for questions and technical support on <code>gpsd</code>, including support
for application builders using <code>gpsd</code> as a component.</p></li>

<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gpsd-dev">gpsd-dev</a>
is for <code>gpsd</code> developers.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>The following manual pages describe the code:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="gpsd.html">gpsd.1</a></dt>
<dd>The <code>gpsd</code> daemon.</dd>

<dt><a href="libgps.html">libgps.3</a></dt>
<dd>An interface library that manages communication with the daemon.</dt>

<dt><a href="libgpsd.html">libgpsd.3</a></dt>
<dd>The low-level library used by <code>gpsd</code> to talk to a GPS.</dd>

<dt><a href="gpsprobe.html">gpsprobe.1</a></dt>
<dd>The <code>gpsprobe</code> program for querying GPS capabilities.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that these describe gpsd-2, not the 1.x versions you may have
seen before.</p>

<h1>The gps client</h1>

<p>Included in the package is a sample client called <code>gps</code>. It
connects to a <code>gpsd</code> at any host you tell it to, and
requests raw data, so that it can display the current location of all
visible GPS satellites your receiver 'sees'.</p>

<p><img SRC="gpsd1.gif" ALT="[image] The GPS receiver has no fix yet."/></p>

<p>The GPS receiver has not yet acquired a fix.  The receiver has not
tracked the grey satellites, but knows where they should be.</p>

<p>The next image shows a good fix. A 3d fix provides latitude, longitude
as well as altitude data, and requires at least four good satellites. A
2d fix does not give altitude, but only requires 3 satellites.</p>

<p><img SRC="gpsd2.gif" ALT="[image] The GPS receiver has a good 3d fix."/></p>

<p>Depending on your GPS receiver, the additional satellites may be used
to determine location with better accuracy.</p>

<h1>Recipes and related resources</h1>

<p><code>gpsd</code> also works with <a href="bt.html">bluetooth
GPS</a> receivers.</p>

<p>Robin Cull has a Gentoo Linux <a
href="http://www.digitalevacuation.org/ebuilds/gpsd-1.07.ebuild">ebuild
script</a>.</p>

<h1>Other GPSDs</h1>

<p>There are two Linux-based forks of <code>gpsd</code> in the wild, but
there are plans to unfork at least one of them soon.  You can read a brief <a
href="history.html">history</a> of the <code>gpsd</code> project if
you are curious.</p>

<p>There is a <a href='http://www.navsys.org/navsys/'>NavSys</a>
project that includes a fork of gpsd called ngpsd.  The developer
is now on the <code>gpsd</code> list and we plan an unfork.</p>

<p>There is a project called <a
href='http://www.mgix.com/gps3d/'>gps3d</a> that ships a gpsd with
similar goals to ours, but which appears to be an independent
development. There haven't been any releases since early 2002.</p>

<p>There is a <code>gpsd</code>-like hack hosted under <a
href='http://www2.musatcha.com/musatcha/computers/software/gpsd/'>Microsoft
Windows</a>. It provides gpsd service from data in netstumbler under
win32.  This way programs such as <a
href='http://www.wigle.net'>JiGLE</a> can still get gps data from
netstumbler. This program is not genetically related to
<code>gpsd</code>.</p>

<p>We aren't the Greenville Public School District or the Greater
Peoria Sanitary District, nor do we have anything to do with the
General Product Safety Directive.</p>
