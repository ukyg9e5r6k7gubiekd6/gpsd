This is a list of NMEA 0183 sentences with field descriptions.
It is primarily intended to help people understand GPS reports.

This list may originally have been redacted from the document cited as
[NMEA2000]; see the list of sources at the end of this document.
The official NMEA standard was not consulted at any point, thus this
document is not a derivative work of that standard and is not
controlled by the rapacious lawyers of NMEA.

It is originally from the gpsdrive distribution, but adds more
information on the following topics:

* Old and new forms of VTG
* Units used in GGA
* Vendor extensions PRWIZCH and PMGNST
* FAA Mode Indicator field for RMC, RMB, VTG, GLL, BWC, XTE.
* New documentation on BWC, DTM, GBS, GRS, GST, MSK, and MSS sentences.
* Sentence examples merged from [GIDS]
* Sentence explanations from [GIDS] and elsewhere
* Corrected badly mangled ZDA description.
* Corrected DPT titling
* Common talker IDs
* Sentences HFB, ITS, TPC, TDS, TFI, TPC, TPR, TPT from [GLOBALSAT].
* Sentence PASHR from [PASHR].

Many of these are only emitted by high-end maritime navigation systems.
Most GPS sensors emit only RMC, GSA, GSV, GLL, and VTG.  Note that the
form of VTG is variable with NMEA version.

In NMEA 2.3, several sentences (APB, BWC, BWR, GLL, RMA, RMB, RMC,
VTG, WCV, and XTE) got a new last field carrying the signal integrity
information needed by the FAA.  (The values in the GGA mode field were
extended to carry this information as well.) Here are the values:

FAA Mode Indicator
     A = Autonomous mode
     D = Differential Mode
     E = Estimated (dead-reckoning) mode
     M = Manual Input Mode
     S = Simulated Mode
     N = Data Not Valid

This field may be empty.  In pre-2.3 versions it is omitted. [NTUM] says
that according to the NMEA specification, it dominates the Status field --
the Status field will be set to "A" (data valid) for Mode Indicators A
and D, and to "V" (data invalid) for all other values of the Mode
Indicator.  This is confirmed by [IEC].

Where a numeric latitude or longitude is given, the two digits
immediately to the left of the decimal point are whole minutes, to the
right are decimals of minutes, and the remaining digits to the left of
the whole minutes are whole degrees.

Eg. 4533.35 is 45 degrees and 33.35 minutes. ".35" of a minute is
exactly 21 seconds.

Eg. 16708.033 is 167 degrees and 8.033 minutes. ".033" of a minute is
about 2 seconds.

According to [UNMEA], the NMEA standard requires that a field (such as
altitude, latitude, or longitude) must be left empty when the GPS has
no valid data for it.  However, many receivers violate this.  It's
common, for example, to see latitude/longitude/altitude figures filled
with zeros when the GPS has no valid data.

The physical-level protocol is RS232C-compatible (actually RS422),
4800bps, 8N1 or 7N2 (the latter is rare but does occur; the FV18 from
San Jose Navigation uses it, for example).  The data is all
ASCII, the high bit is not used.

It appears there is an international standard, IEC 61162-1, published
in 2000, that is essentially NMEA 0183.  [IEC] says "is closely
aligned with NMEA 0183 version 2.30".  Unfortunately, it costs money
and is not redistributable.

Here are the NMEA-standard sentences.  The names are listed without the
"talker ID", a two-character prefix that identifies the type of the 
transmitting unit.  By far the most common talker ID is "GP",
identifying a generic GPS, but all of the following
are well known:

		GP      Global Positioning System receiver
		LC      Loran-C receiver
		II      Integrated Instrumentation
		IN	Integrated Navigation
		EC      Electronic Chart Display & Information System (ECDIS)
		CD	Digital Selective Calling (DSC)

LC - LORAN-C is a marine navigation system run by the U.S. government,
which is planning to shut it down in favor of GPS.  Some non-LORAN
devices emit GLL but use this talker ID for backward-compatibility
reasons, so it may outlast the actual LORAN system.

II - II is emitted by the NMEA interface of a widely-used line of
marine-navigation electronics called the AutoHelm Seatalk system, made
by Raytheon; see also [SEATALK]. 

IN -- Some Garmin GPS units use an IN talker ID.

EC -- ECDIS is a specialized geographical information system intended
to support professional maritime navigation.  NMEA talker units
meeting the ECDIS standard use this prefix.  Some of these emit GLL.

CD -- Modern marine VHF radios have a set of logic collectively known as
Digital Selective Calling (DSC).  These radios typically take data
from a local position indicating device.  This data is used in
conjunction with a unique (FCC assigned) ID to cause your radio to
broadcast your position data to others.  Conversely, these radios are
capable of recieving position data of other stations and emitting
sentences indicating other station positions.  This lets you plot the
position of other vessels on a chart, for instance.  There has been at
least one instance of a DSC enabled radio overloading (mis-using) the
LC talker prefix for this purpose.  Otherwise they use the CD prefix.
A vessel's nav system is likely to have both CD and some other
position indicating talker on its bus(es).

Until the U.S. Coast Guard terminated the Omega Navigation System in
1997, another common talker prefix was "OM" for an Omega Navigation
System receiver.

Here is a more complete list of talker ID prefixes.  Most are not
relevant to GPS systems.

 APB - Autopilot Sentence "B"

This is a fixed form of the APA sentence with some ambiguities removed.

Note: Some autopilots, Robertson in particular, misinterpret "bearing
from origin to destination" as "bearing from present position to
destination". This is likely due to the difference between the APB
sentence and the APA sentence. for the APA sentence this would be the
correct thing to do for the data in the same field. APA only differs
from APB in this one field and APA leaves off the last two fields
where this distinction is clearly spelled out. This will result in
poor performance if the boat is sufficiently off-course that the two
bearings are different.

is transmitted in the GOTO mode, without an active route on your
GPS. WARNING: this is the bearing from the moment you press enter in
the GOTO page to the destination waypoint and is NOT updated
dynamically! To update the information, (current bearing to waypoint),
you will have to press enter in the GOTO page again.

Example 2: $GPBOD,097.0,T,103.2,M,POINTB,POINTA*52

This sentence is transmitted when a route is active. It contains the
active leg information: origin waypoint "POINTA" and destination
waypoint "POINTB", bearing between the two points 97.0 True, 103.2
Magnetic. It does NOT display the bearing from current location to
destination waypoint! WARNING Again this information does not change
until you are on the next leg of the route. (The bearing from POINTA
to POINTB does not change during the time you are on this leg.)

Robin Darroch writes: "As I understand it, DOP is unit-less, and can
only be compared meaningfully to other DOP figures.  A DOP of 4
indicates twice the likelihood of a given position error compared with
a DOP of 2.  The DOP is calculated from the expected errors due to
current geometry of the satellites used to obtain the fix.  The
estimated position errors should show a strong correlation with DOP,
but be completely different in value as they are measured in distance
units (i.e.  metres), and they are trying to tell you "you're very
probably within x metres of this point" rather than "I'm about twice
as sure of my position as I was a couple of minutes ago".

 GSV - Satellites in view

Some GPS receivers may emit more than 12 quadruples (more than three
GPGSV sentences), even though NMEA-0813 doesn't allow this.  (The
extras might be WAAS satellites, for example.) Receivers may also
report quads for satellites they aren't tracking, in which case the
SNR field will be null; we don't know whether this is formally allowed
or not.
