:description: A programmer's guide to NMEA0183, the GPS protocol reporting standard
:keywords: NMEA0183, GPS, standard, protocol
Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>
v2.23, Mar 2019

NMEA 0183 is a proprietary protocol issued by the National Marine
Electronics Association for use in boat navigation and control
systems.  Because early GPS sensors were designed for compatibility
with these systems, GPS reporting protocols are often a small
subset of NMEA 0183 or mutated from such as subset.  AIS, the
Marine Automatic Identification system, also uses NMEA0183-like
packet formats.

This document is a list of NMEA 0183 sentences with field descriptions.
It is primarily intended to help people understand GPS reports, but
also exists because the author finds life-critical protocols with
only closed/proprietary documentation deeply offensive.

The master of this document is in asciidoc format at the GPSD project
website; you are probably seeing it as a web page.  You may encounter
versions of it, in plain ASCII, that do not have a revision number and
do not list an editor. These are older and should be considered
obsolescent.

== Sources and Applicable Standards ==

This collection may originally have been redacted from the document
cited as <<BETKE>>; see the list of sources at the end of this
document.  The official NMEA 0183 standard was not consulted at any
point, thus this document is not a derivative work of that standard
and is not controlled by the rapacious lawyers of NMEA.

It appears there is an international standard, IEC 61162-1, published
in 2000, that is essentially NMEA 0183.  <<IEC61162-1>> says it "is closely
aligned with NMEA 0183 version 2.30".  Unfortunately, it costs money
and is not redistributable.

This collection of sentences is originally from the gpsdrive
distribution, but adds more information on the following topics:

* Old and new forms of VTG
* Units used in GGA
* Vendor extensions PRWIZCH and PMGNST
* FAA Mode Indicator field for RMC, RMB, VTG, GLL, BWC, XTE.
* New documentation on BWC, DTM, GBS, GNS, GRS, GST, MSK, and MSS sentences.
* Sentence examples merged from <<GIDS>>
* Sentence explanations from <<GIDS>> and elsewhere
* Corrected badly mangled ZDA description.
* Corrected DPT titling
* Common talker IDs
* Sentences HFB, ITS, TPC, TDS, TFI, TPC, TPR, TPT from GLOBALSAT.
* Sentence PASHR from <<PASHR>>.
* Satellite IDs: PRN vs NMEA-ID.
* Error status indications.

== Relationship to NMEA 2000 ==

Recently the National Marine Electronics Association has attempted to
replace NMEA 0183 with a very differently structured protocol named
NMEA 2000.  It is binary rather than textual, a profile or
interpretation of the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol used in
automotive networking. Unlike NMEA 0183 it is frame-based and cannot
be transmitted over serial links.

While newer marine electronics uses this protocol, general-purpose
GPSes have not adopted it.  Thus we do not attempt to document NMEA
2000 here; see <<CANBUS>>, <<NMEA2000>>, and <<KEVERSOFT>> instead.

== NMEA version timeline ==

|========================================================================
|NMEA 2.00 | January 1992
|NMEA 2.01 | August 1994
|NMEA 2.10 | October 1995
|NMEA 2.20 | January 1997
|NMEA 2.30 | March 1998
|NMEA 3.00 | July 2000
|NMEA 3.01 | January 2002
|NMEA 4.00 | November 2008
|NMEA 4.10 | July 2012
|========================================================================

No version earlier than 2.00 is listed or archived on the NMEA website.

The NMEA 4.00 standard states, provocatively, that it is "in theory"
backwards compatible to 2.00, and that versions before 2.00 are not
forward-compatible <<ANON>>.

== NMEA 0183 physical protocol layer ==

The NMEA specification requires a physical-level protocol compatible
with RS422 at 4800bps, 8N1 or 7N2.  It is RS422 rather than RS232
because NMEA expects many navigational devices to feed a common serial
bus.  The data encoding is ASCII with the high data bit not used and
zeroed.

Consumer-grade GPS sensors normally report over an RS232 port or a USB
port emulating an RS232 serial device; some use Bluetooth. Baud rate
is variable, with 9600 probably the most common.  Most devices use
8N1; there are rare exceptions that use 7N2 (San Jose Navigation) or
even 8O1 (Trimble).

== Sentence Mixes and NMEA Variations ==

Most GPS sensors emit only RMC, GSA, GSV, GLL, VTG, and (rarely) ZDA.
Newer ones conforming to NMEA 3.x may emit GBS as well. Other NMEA
sentences are usually only emitted by high-end maritime navigation
systems.

The form of VTG is incompatibly variable with NMEA version. See
the detailed description of that sentence for details.

In NMEA 2.3, several sentences (APB, BWC, BWR, GLL, RMA, RMB, RMC,
VTG, WCV, and XTE) got a new last field carrying the signal integrity
information needed by the FAA.  (The values in the GGA mode field were
extended to carry this information as well.) Here are the values:

FAA Mode Indicator
     A = Autonomous mode
     D = Differential Mode
     E = Estimated (dead-reckoning) mode
     F = RTK Float mode
     M = Manual Input Mode
     N = Data Not Valid
     P = Precise (4.00 and later)
     R = RTK Integer mode
     S = Simulated Mode

This field may be empty.  In pre-2.3 versions it is omitted. <<NTUM>> says
that according to the NMEA specification, it dominates the Status field --
the Status field will be set to "A" (data valid) for Mode Indicators A
and D, and to "V" (data invalid) for all other values of the Mode
Indicator.  This is confirmed by <<IEC>>.

In NMEA 3.0, the GBS sentence reports a complete set of error estimates. Note
however that many receivers claiming to emit "3.0" or "3.01" don't
actually ship this sentence.

== NMEA Encoding Conventions ==

Data is transmitted in serial async, 1 start-bit, 8 data-bits,
1 stop-bit, no parity.  Data-bits are in least-significant-bit
order.  The standard specifies 4800 as the speed, but this is no
longer common. The most-signifacant-bit is always zero.

An NMEA sentence consists of a start delimiter, followed by a
comma-separated sequence of fields, followed by the character '*'
(ASCII 42), the checksum and an end-of-line marker.

The start delimiter is normally '$' (ASCII 36). Packets of AIVDM/AIVDO
data, which are otherwise formatted like NMEA, use '!'.  Up to 4.00
these are the only permitted start characters <<ANON>>.

The first field of a sentence is called the "tag" and normally
consists of a two-letter talker ID followed by a three-letter
type code.

Where a numeric latitude or longitude is given, the two digits
immediately to the left of the decimal point are whole minutes, to the
right are decimals of minutes, and the remaining digits to the left of
the whole minutes are whole degrees.

Eg. 4533.35 is 45 degrees and 33.35 minutes. ".35" of a minute is
exactly 21 seconds.

Eg. 16708.033 is 167 degrees and 8.033 minutes. ".033" of a minute is
about 2 seconds.

In NMEA 3.01 (and possibly some earlier versions), the character "^"
(HEX 5E) is reserved as an introducer for two-character hex escapes
using 0-9 and A-F, expressing an ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) character <<ANON>>.

The Checksum is mandatory, and the last field in a sentence.  It is
the 8-bit XOR of all characters in the sentence, excluding the "$", "I",
or "*" characters; but including all "," and "^".  It is encoded as
two hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F), the most-significant-nibble
being sent first.

Sentences are terminated by a <CR><LF> sequence.

Maximum sentence length, including the $ and <CR><LF> is 82 bytes.

According to <<UNMEA>>, the NMEA standard requires that a field (such as
altitude, latitude, or longitude) must be left empty when the GPS has
no valid data for it.  However, many receivers violate this.  It's
common, for example, to see latitude/longitude/altitude figures filled
with zeros when the GPS has no valid data.

== Dates and times ==

NMEA devices report date and time in UTC, aka GMT, aka Zulu time (as
opposed to local time).  But the way this report is computed results
in some odd bugs and inaccuracies.

Date and time in GPS is represented as number of weeks from the start
of zero second of 6 January 1980, plus number of seconds into the
week.  GPS time is not leap-second corrected, though satellites also
broadcast a current leap-second correction which may be updated on
three-month boundaries according to rotational bulletins issued by the
International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).

The leap-second correction is only included in the multiplexed satellite
subframe broadcast, once every 12.5 minutes.  While the satellites do
notify GPSes of upcoming leap-seconds, this notification is not
necessarily processed correctly on consumer-grade devices, and may not
be available at all when a GPS receiver has just cold-booted. Thus,
reported UTC time may be slightly inaccurate between a cold boot or leap
second and the following subframe broadcast.

GPS date and time are subject to a rollover problem in the 10-bit week
number counter, which will re-zero every 1024 weeks (roughly every 19.6
years). The first rollover since GPS went live in 1980 was in Aug-1999,
followed by Apr-2019, the next will be in Nov-2038 (the 32-bit and POSIX
issues will probably be more important by then).  The new "CNAV" data
format extends the week number to 13 bits, with the first rollover
occurring in Jan-2137, but this is only used with some newly added GPS
signals, and is unlikely to be usable in most consumer-grade receivers
currently.

For accurate time reporting, therefore, a GPS requires a supplemental
time references sufficient to identify the current rollover period,
e.g. accurate to within 512 weeks.  Many NMEA GPSes have a wired-in
assumption about the UTC time of the last rollover and will thus report
incorrect times outside the rollover period they were designed in.

For these reasons, NMEA GPSes should not be considered high-quality
references for absolute time.  Some do, however, emit pulse-per-second
RS232 signals which can be used to improve the precision of an
external clock. See <<PPS>> for discussion.

== Error status indications

The NMEA sentences in the normal GPS inventory return four kinds of
validity flags: Mode, Status, the Active/Void bit, and in later
versions the FAA indicator mode.  The FAA mode field is legally
required and orthogonal to the others. Here's how the first three used
in various sentences:

[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|========================================================
|               | GPRMC  |   GPGLL  |   GPGGA  |   GPGSA
|Returns A/V    |  Yes   |    Yes   |    No    |     No
|Returns mode   |  No    |    No    |    No    |     Yes
|Returns status |  No    |    Yes   |    Yes   |     No
|========================================================

The "Navigation receiver warning" is 'A' for Active and 'V' for Void.
(or warning).  You will see it when either there is no satellite lock,
or to indicate a valid fix that has a DOP too high, or which fails an
elevation test. In the latter case the visible sats are below some
fixed elevation of the horizon (usually 15%, but some GPSes make this
adjustable) making position unreliable due to poor geometry and more
variable signal lag induced by lengthened atmosphere transit.

Mode is associated with the GSA sentence associated with the last fix.
It reports whether the fix was no good, sufficient for 2D, or
sufficient for 3D (values 1, 2, and 3).

Status will be 0 when the sample from which the reporting
sentence was generated does not have a valid fix, 1 when it has
a valid (normal-precision) fix, and 2 when the fig is DGPS corrected
(reducing the base error).

In addition, some sentences may use empty fields to signify invalid
data. It is not clear whether NMEA 0183 allows this, but real-world
software must cope.

.FAA Mode Indicator
|================================================================
|A | Autonomous mode
|D | Differential mode
|E | Estimated (dead reckoning) mode
|M | Manual input mode
|S | Simulator mode
|N | Data not valid
|================================================================

== Talker IDs ==

NMEA sentences do not identify the individual device that issued
them; the format was originally designed for shipboard multidrop
networks on which it's possible only to broadcast to all devices, not
address a specific one.

NMEA sentences do, however, include a "talker ID" a two-character
prefix that identifies the type of the transmitting unit.  By far the
most common talker ID is "GP", identifying a generic GPS, but all of
the following are well known:

.Common talker IDs
|================================================================
|BD     | BeiDou (China)
|CD     | Digital Selective Calling (DSC)
|EC     | Electronic Chart Display & Information System (ECDIS)
|GA     | Galileo Positioning System
|GB     | BeiDou (China)
|GL     | GLONASS, according to IEIC 61162-1
|GN     | Mixed GPS and GLONASS data, according to IEIC 61162-1
|GP     | Global Positioning System receiver
|II     | Integrated Instrumentation
|IN     | Integrated Navigation
|LC     | Loran-C receiver (obsolete)
|QZ     | QZSS regional GPS augmentation system (Japan)
|================================================================

EC -- ECDIS is a specialized geographical information system intended
to support professional maritime navigation.  NMEA talker units
meeting the ECDIS standard use this prefix.  Some of these emit GLL.

II -- II is emitted by the NMEA interfaces of several widely-used lines
of marine-navigation electronics. One is the AutoHelm system by
Raymarine; see also <<SEATALK>> for the native protocol of these
devices.

IN -- Some Garmin GPS units use an IN talker ID.

CD -- Modern marine VHF radios use conventions collectively known as
Digital Selective Calling (DSC).  These radios typically take data
from a local position indicating device.  This data is used in
conjunction with a unique (FCC assigned) ID to cause your radio to
broadcast your position data to others.  Conversely, these radios are
capable of recieving position data of other stations and emitting
sentences indicating other station positions.  This lets you plot the
position of other vessels on a chart, for instance.  There has been at
least one instance of a DSC enabled radio overloading (mis-using) the
LC talker prefix for this purpose.  Otherwise they use the CD prefix.
A vessel's nav system is likely to have both CD and some other
position indicating talker on its bus(es).

LC -- Loran-C is a marine navigation system formerly run by many
governments (USA, Canada, Russia, etc.).  It was shut down in most
countries by the end of 2010.  Norway and France shutdown their's in
2015.  Some non-Loran devices emit GLL but use this talker ID for
backward-compatibility reasons, so it outlasted the actual Loran-C
system.

Until the U.S. Coast Guard terminated the Omega Navigation System in
1997, another common talker prefix was "OM" for an Omega Navigation
System receiver.

Here is a more complete list of talker ID prefixes.  Most are not
relevant to GPS systems.

Note that talker IDs made obsolete by newer revisions of the
standards may still be emitted by older devices.  Support
for them may be present in the GPSD project.

|================================================================

== Satellite IDs ==

Satellites may be identified by one of two different numbers in
sentences such as GSV: a PRN number associated with their radio code,
or an NMEA-ID.

For satellites 1-32, the GPS constellation, these numbers are the
same. For satellites associated with WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation
System), EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service),
and MSAS (Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System), they are
different.

Here is a table of NMEA-ID allocations above 32 as of March 2010:

[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====================================================
|System     |Satellite       |PRN            |NMEA-ID
|EGNOS      |AOR-E           |120            |33
|EGNOS      |Artemis         |124            |37
|EGNOS      |IOR-W           |126            |39
|MSAS       |MTSAT-1         |129            |42
|EGNOS      |IOR-E           |131            |44
|WAAS       |AMR             |133            |46
|WAAS       |PanAm           |135            |48
|MSAS       |MTSAT-2         |137            |50
|WAAS       |Anik            |138            |51
|====================================================

Theoretically, all NMEA-emitting devices should emit NMEA-IDs. In
practice, some pass through PRNs.

To avoid possible confusion caused by repetition of satellite ID
numbers when using multiple satellite systems, the following
convention has been adopted:

a. GPS satellites are identified by their PRN numbers, which range from 1 to 32.

b. The numbers 33-64 are reserved for WAAS satellites. The WAAS system
PRN numbers are 120-138. The offset from NMEA WAAS SV ID to WAAS PRN
number is 87. A WAAS PRN number of 120 minus 87 yields the SV ID of 33.
The addition of 87 to the SV ID yields the WAAS PRN number.

c. The numbers 65-96 are reserved for GLONASS satellites. GLONASS
satellites are identified by 64+satellite slot number. The slot
numbers are 1 through 24 for the full constellation of 24 satellites,
this gives a range of 65 through 88. The numbers 89 through 96 are
available if slot numbers above 24 are allocated to on-orbit spares.

Other sources such as <<SATSTAT>> confirm that the NMEA standard
assigns NMEA IDs 65-96 to GLONASS.  The following
table is our best guess of NMEA usage in 2018:

[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====================================================
| 1 - 32    | GPS
| 33 - 54   | Various SBAS systems (EGNOS, WAAS, SDCM, GAGAN, MSAS)
| 55 - 64   | not used (might be assigned to further SBAS systems)
| 65 - 88   | GLONASS
| 89 - 96   | GLONASS (future extensions?)
| 97 - 119  | not used
| 120 - 151 | not used (SBAS PRNs occupy this range)
| 152 - 158 | Various SBAS systems (EGNOS, WAAS, SDCM, GAGAN, MSAS)
| 159 - 172 | not used
| 173 - 182 | IMES
| 193 - 197 | QZSS
| 196 - 200 | QZSS (future extensions?)
| 201 - 235 | BeiDou (u-blox, not NMEA)
| 301 - 336 | GALILEO
| 401 - 437 | BeiDou (NMEA)
|====================================================

GLONASS satellite numbers come in two flavors.  If a sentence
has a GL talker ID, expect the skyviews to be GLONASS-only and
in the range 1-32; you must add 64 to get a globally-unique
NMEA ID.  If the sentence has a GN talker ID, the device emits
a multi-constellation skyview with GLONASS IDs already in
the 65-96 range.

QZSS is a  geosynchronous (*not geostationary*) system of three
(possibly four) satellites in highly elliptical, inclined,
orbits.  It is designed to provide coverage in Japan's
urban canyons.

BeiDou-1 consists of 4 geostationary satellites operated by China,
operational since 2004.  Coverage area is the Chinese mainland.
gpsd does not support this, as this requires special hardware,
and prior arrangements with the operator, who calculates and
returns the position fix.

BeiDou-2 (earlier known as COMPASS) is a system of 35 satellites,
including 5 geostationary for compatibility with BeiDou-1.
As of late 2015, coverage is complete over most of Asia and the
West Pacific.  It is expected to be fully operational by 2020, by
when coverage area is expected to be worldwide.

Note that the PRN system is becoming increasingly fragmented and
unworkable.  New GPS denote each satellite, and their signals, by their
constellation (gnssID), satellite id in that constellation (svId), and
signal type (sigId).  NMEA, as of version 4, has not adapted.

== Obsolete sentences ==

Note that sentences made obsolete by newer revisions of the
standards may still be emitted by devices.
Support for them may be present in the GPSD project.

The following NMEA sentences have been designated "obsolete" in a

=== APA - Autopilot Sentence "A" ===

This sentence is sent by some GPS receivers to allow them to be used
to control an autopilot unit. This sentence is commonly used by
autopilots and contains navigation receiver warning flag status,
cross-track-error, waypoint arrival status, initial bearing from
origin waypoint to the destination, continuous bearing from present
position to destination and recommended heading-to-steer to
destination waypoint for the active navigation leg of the journey.

=== APB - Autopilot Sentence "B" ===

This is a fixed form of the APA sentence with some ambiguities removed.

Note: Some autopilots, Robertson in particular, misinterpret "bearing
from origin to destination" as "bearing from present position to
destination". This is likely due to the difference between the APB
sentence and the APA sentence. for the APA sentence this would be the
correct thing to do for the data in the same field. APA only differs
from APB in this one field and APA leaves off the last two fields
where this distinction is clearly spelled out. This will result in
poor performance if the boat is sufficiently off-course that the two
bearings are different.

is transmitted in the GOTO mode, without an active route on your
GPS. WARNING: this is the bearing from the moment you press enter in
the GOTO page to the destination waypoint and is NOT updated
dynamically! To update the information, (current bearing to waypoint),
you will have to press enter in the GOTO page again.

Example 2: $GPBOD,097.0,T,103.2,M,POINTB,POINTA*52

This sentence is transmitted when a route is active. It contains the
active leg information: origin waypoint "POINTA" and destination
waypoint "POINTB", bearing between the two points 97.0 True, 103.2
Magnetic. It does NOT display the bearing from current location to
destination waypoint! WARNING Again this information does not change
until you are on the next leg of the route. (The bearing from POINTA
to POINTB does not change during the time you are on this leg.)

=== GSV - Satellites in view ===

This is one of the sentences commonly emitted by GPS units.

These sentences describe the sky position of a UPS satellite in view.
Typically they're shipped in a group of 2 or 3.

    $GPGSV,3,3,11,22,42,067,42,24,14,311,43,27,05,244,00,,,,*4D

Some GPS receivers may emit more than 12 quadruples (more than three
GPGSV sentences), even though NMEA-0813 doesn't allow this.  (The
extras might be WAAS satellites, for example.) Receivers may also
report quads for satellites they aren't tracking, in which case the
SNR field will be null; we don't know whether this is formally allowed
or not.

‘TM’ indicates message generated by SML tracking system.  ‘VTD’ is
name of the message.

Field Number:

1. Day/month/year (two-digit year, unknown base century)
2. Hour/minute/second to 0.1 sec precion, UTC.
3. ‘R’ indicates that this is an update for a radar track. No other
   values are valid
4. Internal unique ID number. Can’t be changed even when target is
   re-identified
5. Target alias. Can be changed when the target identification data is
   edited.  Symbols “$”, “*” “,” and “.”  are not allowed to be used
   within the alias word. This field is variable length, at most 21v
   characters.
6. Latitude in degrees (two leading digits) and decimal minutes
   (trailing digits).
7. N or S for North or South latitude.
8. Longitude in degrees (three leading digits) and decimal minutes
   (trailing digits).
9. E or W for East or West longitude.
10. Target course in decimal degrees.
11. Fixed to T, indicates true course.
12. Target speed in decimal knots.
13. Fixed to N, indicates decimal speed in knots.
14. T or D. T = tracked, D = dropped. Message with status
    “dropped” is sent only once after target is dropped.
15. NMEA checksum.
