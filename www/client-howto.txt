== Introduction ==

This document is a guide to interfacing client applications with GPSD.
It surveys the available bindings and their use cases.  It also explains
some sharp edges in the client API which, unfortunely, are fundamental
results of the way GPS sensor devices operate, and suggests tactics
for avoiding being cut.

== Sensor behavior matters ==

GPSD handles two main kinds of sensors: GPS receivers and AIS
receivers. It has rudimentary support for some other kinds of
specialized geolocation-related sensors as well, notably compass and
yaw/pitch/roll, but those sensors are usually combined with GPS/AIS
receivers and behave like them.

In an ideal world, GPS/AIS sensors would be oracles that you could
poll at any time to get clean data. But despite the existence of some
vendor-specific query and control strings on some devices, a GPS/AIS
sensor is not a synchronous device you can query for specified data
and count on getting a response back from in a fixed period of time.
It gets radio data on its own schedule (usually once per second for a
GPS), and emits the reports it feels like reporting asynchronously
with variable lag during the following second.  *If* it supports query
strings, reports from these are intermixed with the regular
reports, and usually scheduled at a lower priority (often with a lag
of more than a second).

A GPS/AIS receiver, or any sensor that behaves like one, is in effect
a datagram emitter similar to a UDP data source; you get no guarantees
about sequence or timing at finer resolution than "TPV roughly once
per second" (or whatever the main type of report and report interval
is).

The only way to simulate synchronous querying of such a sensor is to
have an agent between you and it that caches the data coming out of
the device; you can then query the agent and expect a reasonably
synchronous response from the cache (we support this for
GPSes). However, note that this doesn't work for a freshly opened
device - there's no cached data.

Consider what this implies for GPses, in particular:

* You can't actually poll them. They report to you over a serial
  (RS232 or USB-serial) interface at a fixed interval, usually once
  per second.

* They don't always have a fix to report, because they can only
  get one when they have satellite lock.

* They may fail to have satellite lock when your skyview is poor.
  If you are moving through uneven terrain or anywhere with trees 
  or buildings, your skyview can degrade in an instant.

* They may also fail to have lock because they're initially powering
  on (cold start), or waking from a power-conserving sleep mode (warm
  start).  While most modern GPSes with a good skyview can get
  satellite lock in 30 seconds from a warm start, a GPS that has
  been off for a while can take 15 minutes or more to acquire lock

Time to fix after a power-on matters because in many use cases for
GPSes they're running off a battery, and you can't afford to keep them
powered when you don't actually need location data.  This is why GPS
sensors are sometimes designed to go to a low-power mode when you close
the serial port they're attached to.

AIS receivers have a simpler set of constraints. They report
navigational and ID information from any AIS transmitter in line of
sight; there are no skyview issues, and they're ready instantly when
powered up. Furthermore, they're not normally battery constrained.
However, you don't poll them either; they receive information
packets over the air and ship them to you at unpredictable intervals
over a serial port.

The design of the GPSD reporting protocol surrenders to reality. Its data
packets translate the GPS's stream of datagrams into
device-type-independent datagrams, but it can't impose timing and
sequencing regularities on them that the underlying device doesn't
already obey.

== What GPSD does, and what it cannot do ==

GPSD solves some of the problems with GPS/AIS sensors. First:
multiplexing; it allows multiple applications to get sensor data
without having to contend for a single serial device.  Second:
coping with the hideous gallimaufry of badly-designed protocols these
devices use -- regardless of device type, you will get data in a single
well-documented format.  Third: on operating systems with a hotplug
facility (like Linux udev), GPSD will handle all the device 
management as USB devices are plugged in and unplugged.

What GPSD can't do is pull fix data out of thin air when your 
device han't reported any.  Nor is it a magic power supply,
so its device management has to be designed around keeping the
attached sensors open only when a client application actually
needs a fix. 

As you'll see, these constraints explain most of the design of the GPSD
wire protocol, and of the library APIs your client application 
will be using.

== How the GPSD wire protocol works ==

While GPSD project ships several library bindings that will hide the
details of the wire protocol from you, you'll understand the library APIs
better by knowing what a wire-protocol session looks like. After
reading this section, you can forget the details about commands and
responses and attributes as long as you hold on to the basic 
logical flow of a session.

Your client library's open function is going to connect a socket to
port 2947 on the host your sensors are attached to, usually
localhost. On connection, the gpsd daemon will ship a banner that
looks something like this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
{"class":"VERSION","release":"2.93","rev":"2010-03-30T12:18:17",
                   "proto_major":3,"proto_minor":2}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's nothing mysterious here. Your server daemon is identifying
itself with information that may allow a client library to work
around bugs or potential incompatibilities produced by upgrades.

To get data from the attached sensors, you need to explicitly tell the
daemon you want it.  (Remember that it's trying to minimize the amount
of time the devices are held open and in a fully powered state.)  You
do this by issuing a WATCH command:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
?WATCH={"enable":true,"json":true}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tells the daemon to watch all devices and to issue reports in
JSON.  It can ship some other protocols as well (notably, NMEA 0183)
but JSON is the most capable and usually what you want.

A side effect of the WATCH command is that the daemon will ship you
back some information on available devices.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
{"class":"DEVICES","devices":[{"class":"DEVICE","path":"/dev/ttyUSB0","activated":1269959537.20,"native":0,"bps":4800,"parity":"N","stopbits":1,"cycle":1.00}]}
{"class":"WATCH","enable":true,"json":true,"nmea":false,"raw":0,"scaled":false,"timing":false}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DEVICES response tells you what devices are available to the
daemon; this list is maintained in a way you as the application
designer don't have to care about.  The WATCH response will
immediately follow and tells you what all your watch request settings
are.

Up to this point, nothing has been dependent on the state of the
sensors. At this time, it may well be that none of those devices is
fully powered up yet. In fact, thet won't be, unless another
GPSD-enabled application is already watching when you open your
connection.  If that's the case, you will start seeing data
immediately.

For now, though, let's go back to the case where gpsd has to fire up
the sensors. After issuing the WATCH response, the daemon opens all of
them and watches for incoming packets that it can recognize.  *After
a variable delay*, it will ship a notification that looks something
like this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
{"class":"DEVICE","path":"/dev/ttyUSB0","activated":1269960793.97,
                 "driver":"SiRF binary","native":1,"bps":4800,
                 "parity":"N","stopbits":1,"cycle":1.00}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the daemon telling you that it has recognized a SiRF binary
GPS on /dev/ttyUSB0 shipping report packets at 4800 bits per second.
This notification is not delayed by the time it takes to achieve
satellite lock; the GPS will cheerfully ship packets before that.  But
it will be delayed by the time required for the daemon to sync up with
the GPS.

The GPSD daemon is designed so it doesn't have to know anything about the
sensor in advance - not which of a dozen reporting protocols it uses,
and not even the baud rate of the serial device.  The reason for this
agnosticism is so the daemon can adapt properly to anything a hotplug 
event night throw at it.  If you unplug your GPS while your
application is running, and then plug one one of a different type, the
daemon will cope.  Your application won't know the difference unless
you have told it to notice device types.

You can even start your application, have it issue a WATCH, realize
you forgot to plug in a GPS, and do that.  The hotplug event will
tell gpsd, which will add the new device to the watched-devices list
of every client that has issued a ?WATCH.

In order to make this work, gpsd has a packet sniffer inside it that
does autobauding and packet-protocol detection. Normally the packet
sniffer will achive sync in well under a second (my measured times
range from 0.10 to 0.53 sec at 4800bps), but it can take longer if
your serial traffic is degraded by dodgy cables or electrical noise,
or if the GPS is configured to run at an unusual speed/parity/stopbit
configuration.

The real point here is that the delay is *variable*.  The client 
library, and your application, can't assume a neat lockstep of
request and instant response.

Once you do get your device(s) synced, things become more predictable.
The sensor will start shipping fix reports at a constant interval,
usually every second, and the daemon will massage them into JSON and
pass them up the client to your application.  

However, until the sensor achives satellite lock, those fixes will be
"mode 1" - no valid data (mode 2 is a 2D fix, mode 3 is a 3D fix).
Here's what that looks like:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
{"class":"TPV","tag":"MID2","device":"/dev/ttyUSB0",
               "time":1269964063.670,"ept":0.005,"mode":1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Occasionally you'll get another kind of sentence, SKY, that reports a
satellite skyview.  But TPV is the important one.  Here's what it
looks like when the sensor has a fix to report:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
{"class":"TPV","tag":"MID2","time":1119197547.890,"ept":0.005,
               "lat":46.498204497,"lon":7.568061439,"alt":1327.689,
                "epx":15.319,"epy":17.054,"epv":124.484,"track":10.3797,
                "speed":0.091,"climb":-0.085,"eps":34.11,"mode":3}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the "mode":3 at the end.  This is how you tell that the GPS ia
reporting a full 3D fix with altitude.

If you have an AIS receiver attached, it too will have been opened
and autobauded and protocol-sniffed after your WATCH.  The stream of
JSON objects will then include things like this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
{"class":"AIS","type":5,"repeat":0,"mmsi":351759000,"scaled":true,
               "imo":9134270,"ais_version":0,"callsign":"3FOF8",
               "shipname":"EVER DIADEM",
               "shiptype":"Cargo - all ships of this type",
               "to_bow":225,
	       "to_stern":70,"to_port":1,"to_starboard":31,"draught":12.2,
               "epfd":"GPS","eta":"05-15T14:00Z",
	       "destination":"NEW YORK","dte":0}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When your application shuts down, it can cancel its watch:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
?WATCH={"enable":false}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will enable the daemon to close devices and conserve
power. Supposing you don't do this, the daemon will time out devices
with no listeners, so canceling your watch is not strictly necessary.
But it is good manners.

If you're a clever sort, you're already wondering what the daemon does
if the application at the other end of the client socket doesn't read data
out of it as fast as gpsd is shipping it upwards.  And the answer is
this: eventually the socket buffer fills up, a write from the daemon 
throws an error, and the daemon shuts down that client socket.  

From the point of view of the application, it reads all the buffered
data and then gets a read return indicating the socket shutdown. We'll
return to this in the discussion of client libraries, but the thing
for you to know right now is that this edge case is actually quite
difficult to fall afoul of.  Total data volume on these sockets is not
high. As long as your application checks for and reads socket data no
less often than once a second, you won't -- and a second is a *lot* of
time in which to come back around your main loop.

== Interfacing from the client side ==

The GPSD project provides client-side libraries in C, C++, and Python.
A Perl module is separately available from CPAN.  While the details of
these libraries vary, they all have the same two purposes and the same
limitations. 

One purpose of the libraries is to handle the details of unpacking
JSON-based wire-protocol objects into whatever native structure/record
feature your application language has. This is particularly important
in the C and C++ libraries, because those languages don't have
good native support for JSON.

Another purpose is to hide the details of the wire protocol from the
application.  This gives the GPSD developers room to improve extend
the protocol without breaking every client application.  Depend
on wire-protocol details only at your own risk!

The limitations the libraries have to cope with are the nature of
the data flow from the sensors, and the simple fact that they're
not necessarily delivering fixes at any given time.  

For details of the libraries' APIs, see their reference
documentation; the objective of the rest of this section is to teach
you the general model of client-side interfacing that they all have to
follow because of the way the daemon works.

Each library has the following entry points:

* Open a session socket to the daemon.  Named something like "open()".

* Set watch policy. Named something like "stream()"

* Send wire-protocol commands to the daemon. Deprecated; makes your
  code dependent on the wire protocol. There is no longer a real
  use case for this entry point; if you think you need no use it, 
  you have probably failed to understand the rest of the interface.

* Nonblocking check to see if data from the daemon is waiting. Named
  something like "waiting()".

* Blocking read for data from the daemon.  Named something like "read()"
  (this was "poll()" in older versions).

* Close the session socket. Named something like "close()".

* Enable debugging trace messages

Here is a complete table of the binding entry points:

.Entry points in client bindings
[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|========================================================================
|C			|C++			|Python			|
Function
|gps_open()		|gpsmm.gpsmm()		|gps.\_\_init__()	|

Set a hook function to be executed on each raw packet as it arrives.
|gps_send()		|gpsmm.send()		|gps.send()		|
Send wire-protocol commands to the daemon. Deprecated and unstable.
|gps_stream()		|gpsmm.stream()		|gps.stream()		|
Set watch policy. What you should use instead of send().
|gps_waiting()		|gpsmm.waiting()	|gps.waiting()		|
Nonblocking check to see in input is waiting.

|gps_enable_debug()	|gpsmm_enable_debug()	|			|
Enable debug tracing.  Only useful for GPSD developers.
			|gpsmm.clear_fix()	|			|
Clear the contents of the fix structure.
|========================================================================

The tricky part is interpreting what you get from the blocking
read. The reason it's tricky is that you're not guaranteed that
every read will pick up exactly one complete JSON object from the 
daemon. It may grab one response object, or more than one, or
part of one, or one or more followed by a fragment.

What the library does on each read is this: get what it can from the
socket, append that to a private buffer, and then consume as many JSON
objects from the front of the buffer as it can.  Any incomplete JSON
is left in the private buffer to be completed and unpacked on a later
go-round.

In C, the library "consumes" a JSON object by unpacking its content
into a blackboard structure passed to the read entry point by
address. The structure contains a state-flag mask that you can (and
should!) check so you'll know which parts of the structure contain
valid data.  It is safe to do nothing unless the PACKET_SET mask bit
is on, which is the library's way of telling you that at least one
complete JSON response has arrived since the last read.

Data may accumulate on the blackboard over multiple reads,
with new TPV reports overwriting old ones;it is guaranteed that
overwrites are not partial.  Expect this pattern to be replicated
in any compiled language with only fixed-extent structures.

In Python and Perl the read entry point returns an object containing
accumulated data.  The state-flag mask is still useful for telling you
which parts contain data, and there is still a PACKET_SET bit.  Expect
this pattern to be replicated in other dynamic OO languages when we
support them.

The C++ binding is a very thin wrapper around the C.  You get back an
object, but it's just a reference to the C blackboard structure.

All bindings will throw a recognizable error from the read entry
point when the socket is closed from the daemon side.

== C Examples ==

The source distribution includes two example clients in C; 
gpxlogger.c and cgps.c.  

gpxlogger.c illustrates the simplest possible program flow; open,
followed by stream, followed by blocking reads forever.  The use of
select is not strictly necessary, but illustrates how to wait for data
from the daemon; it would work even if the read were
non-blocking. This would only be appropriate for a batch-mode report
generator.

cgps.c shows what an interactive application using the library and
also processing user commands works. Observe the use of select(2)
to wait on either data from the daemon or a keystroke.

== Python examples ==

There's a very simple Python example analogous to gpxlogger attached
to the source code for the gps.py library.

The heart of it is this code:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    session = gps(**opts)
    session.set_raw_hook(lambda s: sys.stdout.write(s.strip() + "\n"))
    session.stream(WATCH_ENABLE|WATCH_NEWSTYLE)
    for report in session:
        print report
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For more interesting example integrated with X and GTK, see xgps and
xgpsspeed.

== Backward Incompatibility and Future Changes ==

The C/C++ binding makes available two preprocessor symbols,
GPSD_API_MAJOR_VERSION and GPSD_API_MINOR_VERSION, in gps.h.
The Python module has corresponding symbols.

In major versions before 5:

* gps_open() didn't take a third argument; instead, it returned malloc storage.

* The 'read()' method in various bindings was named 'poll()' and had
  a different return convention. The name 'poll()' will at some point
  be reintroduced as an interface to the wire-protocol POLL command.

* Clients needed to define a gpsd_report() function for client-side logging
  if they didn't want code in netlib.c and libgps_core.c to occasionally
  senfd messages to stderr.  This requirement is now gone.
