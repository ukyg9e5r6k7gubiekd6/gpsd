<h1>GPSD Receiver Reporting Form</h1>

<p><b>NOTE: Due to a Perl dependency coming unstuck, this form is in the
process of being translated to Python and is not presently complete or
usable.  The management regrets any inconvenience.</b></p>

<form action="%(request_uri)s" method=POST enctype="multipart/form-data">

<p>Please use this form to report <code>gpsd</code> successes or
failures with GPS and AIS units, and also to upload a sample of the receiver\'s
output so we can add it to our regression tests and ensure continued
support of the device.</p>

<p>Fields marked <em style="color: #ff0000;">Important!</em> have to be filled
in for the report to be useful.  These are: submitter contact address, vendor,
model, documentation URL, and output sample.  Other fields represent things we
might be able to find out ourselves, but which are easier for you to determine.
Every bit of information you can give us about your receiver will help make the
support for it more reliable.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Contact information</h2>

<p><em style="color: #ff0000;">Important!</em> We prefer a valid email
address for you in case we need to ask you followup questions about
the device.  While we won\'t use your address for anything other than
asking you questions about your receiver, and maybe asking you to test
specific changes, this gps report will be sent to the gpsd-dev list
which is publicly archived.</p>

<p>Example: <code>Eric Raymond &lt;esr&#x40;thyrsus.com&gt;</code></p>

<p><em>Name and email address: </em>
<input type="text" 
       name="submitter" 
       size="72" 
       value="%(submitter)s"></p>

<p>(It is not actually very likely we will contact you, but we need to
be able to do it if we can find no other way of getting information
about the device.  Expect to hear from us if your receiver is obsolescent or
exotic and the information you provide in the rest of this form turns
out to be insufficient. Or if your browser is broken enough to botch
the output-sample upload.)</p>

<hr>
<h2>Receiver type identification</h2>

<p><em style=:color: #ff0000;">Important!</em> Identify the vendor and model of
your device.</p>

<p>Example: <code>Haicom</code> and <code>303S</code>.</p>

<p><em>Vendor:&nbsp;</em>
<input type="text" 
       name="vendor" 
       size="72" 
       value="%(vendor)s"></p>

<p><em>Model:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
<input type="text" 
       name="model" 
       size="72" 
       value="%(model)s"></p>

<p><em style="color: #ff0000;">Important!</em> We need a URL pointing to a
technical manual for the device.  You can usually find this on the
vendor\'s website by giving a search engine the product name.  If it\'s
not linked directly from the vendor\'s page for the individual product,
look under "Technical Support" or "Product support" on the vendor\'s
main page.</p>

<p>Example: <code>http://www.haicom.com.tw/gps303s.shtml</code></p>

<p><em>URL of a technical manual:</em>
<input type="text" 
       name="techdoc" 
       size="72"
       value="%(techdoc)s"></p>

<p>It is useful to have an indication of how the receiver is packaged.

<p>Please identify the device chipset and firmware version, if possible.  You
may be able to get this from the display of <code>xgps</code>; look for
a Device Type field or at the window title bar. Alternatively, you may find
it in the technical manual.</p>

tell us about it in "Technical Notes".</p>

<h2>Technical notes</h2>

<p>Now tell us the things that didn\'t fit in the rest of the form.
Appropriate things to put here include how to read any LEDs or other
unlabeled indicators on the device, a warning that the product has
been discontinued, a list of alternate interfaces, descriptions of
errors in the documentation, applicable PPS offsets, descriptions of
special abilities such as the ability to vary the sampling interval,
and a note if it\'s an OEM module rather than a retail product.
Anything else you think we need to know should go here too.</p>

<textarea name="notes" rows="10", cols="72"></textarea>

<hr>
<h2>Output sample</h2>

<p><em style=\'color: #ff0000;\'>Important!</em> We need a sample of the output
from your receiver - not the gpsd logfile, just raw output.  We\'ll use this for
mechanical regression testing, which is your best guarantee that support for
your device won\'t get broken in a future release. Please be advised that these
logs will be sent to a publicly archived mailing list, and will be available in
the public code repository.</p>

<p>Almost all receivers will simply start throwing data to your port
immediately when they\'re plugged in. You should normally be able to capture
this output to a file with the <code>gpscat</code> utility.</p>

<p>There will be some unusual cases in which this isn\'t possible,
because the device needs some kind of activation sequence written to
it before it will start reporting.  Some Garmin GPSes (the ones that
speak Garmin binary protocol rather than NMEA) are like this.  If you
think you have one of these, ask for help on GPSD\'s development mailing 
list</a>.</p>

<p>A log file is most useful when it contains (a) some sentences
generated when the receiver has no fix, (b) some sentences representing
a fix with the unit stationary, and (c) some sentences representing
a fix with the unit moving.</p>

<input type="file" name="output_sample_file">
<input type="hidden" name="output_sample_content" value="%(output_sample_content)s">

<p>There is some auxiliary data we like to have in our regression-test
files.</p>

<p>Location of the log capture. A good format would include your
nearest city or other landmark, state/province, country code, and a
rough latitude/longitude.  A GPS will give an exact location; we
want this as a sanity check.</p>

<p>Example: <code>Groningen, NL, 53.2N 6.6E</code></p>

<p><em>Location:&nbsp;</em>
<input type="text" 
       name="location" 
       size="72" 
       value="%(location)s"></p>

<p>Year-Month-Day of the log capture (the receiver will give us
hour/minute/second).</p>

<p>Example: <code>2011-05-14</code>.</p>

<p><em>Date:&nbsp;</em>
<input type="text" 
       name="date" 
       size="72" 
       value="%(date)s"></p>


<p>Finally, add any notes you want to about how the sample was taken.  One
good thing to put here would a description of how the unit was moving while the
log was being captured.  If the sentence mix changes between "fix" and "no fix"
states, that too is a good thing to note.</p>
