<p>This is a gentle introduction to writing GPS-aware applications
&mdash; or, How I Stopped Worrying And Learned To Love Spherical
Trigonometry. It will explain the capabilities and limitations of GPS
hardware and the <code>gpsd</code> software that you need to know about when
writing location-aware applications.</p>

<p>We'll go from general to specific, beginning with an overview of how
GPS works and ending with architectural suggestions about how to use
<code>gpsd</code> to make your application location-aware.</p>

<p>Developers who have written applications with <code>gpsd</code> 1.x
may want to skip directly to the advice on <a
href="#migrating">programming with gpsd-2</a>.</p>

<h2>How GPS Works</h2>

<p>First, the basics of how GPS works.  It depends on the fact that
satellite orbits are very predictable.  A GPS sensor is a specialized
computer that knows about the orbits of GPS satellites, and in
particular can predict exactly where each satellite will be at any
given time with respect to the fixed Earth.  (For those of you who
enjoy such details, what they actually predict is each satellite's
position with respect to an imaginary ellipsoid called the "WGS 84
geoid" which closely fits the mean sea level of Earth.)</p>

<p>There are presently 28 dedicated GPS satellites, 11,000 miles up in
high-inclination orbits so that their trajectory wraps around the
Earth like a ball of yarn as the planet spins beneath them.  The
inclinations are tuned to guarantee that about twelve will be visible
at any given time from anywhere on Earth (coverage falls off a little
at high latitudes).  Additional GPS coverage is provided by a couple
of maritime navigation satellites parked in geosynchronous orbits over
the middle of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.</p>

<p>You can look at a very nifty <a
href="http://www.mich.com/%7Ebuffalo/rhp/gps.html">simulation</a>
of GPS satellite orbits. (Also includes GLONASS, the Russian military 
equivalent of GPS.)  You can also look at 
<a href='http://www.tsgc.utexas.edu/images/spacecraft/gps/'>pictures</a> 
of GPS satellites and the control systm.</p>

<p>Each satellite broadcasts identification pulses, each one including
the clock time it was sent. A GPS receiver, picking up one of these
pulses, can compare it to an internal clock and know the time it took
to arrive. Multiplying by lightspeed gives the distance to the
satellite.  This starts to be useful when the GPS can get accurate
timings to three or more satellites; at that point, computing the
GPS's exact position with respect to the satellites becomes a relatively
simple if tedious exercise in spherical trigonometry (which,
fortunately, the GPS's firmware does for you).</p>

<p>That's the theory.  In practice, the system has important limits.
Anything, natural or artificial, that messes with the signal timings
will degrade the accuracy of your position fix.  Until it was
abolished by Presidential decree in 2000, the most important limit was
artificial, the so-called 'Selective Availability' feature.  The
satellites were programmed to introduce patterned timing jitter into
the signals.  The U.S. military knew the pattern, but nobody else did
(or, at least, nobody who was admitting it).</p>

<p>Now that 'Selective Availability' is gone, the important limits are
natural.  One is a variable amount of signal lag produced as the GPS
signals pass through the ionosphere, which partly reflects radio waves.
This can be largely compensated for by a technique called "Differential
GPS" or DGPS, in which your receiver takes timings both from satellites
and ground stations.  The ground stations can measure and compensate for
the ionospheric lag.</p>

<p>In practice, though. the most important limit is the actual
visibility of satellites.  A timing signal has to be fairly strong and
clear, with little noise or distortion, before a GPS can use it.  The
frequencies GPS has to use in order to punch through the ionosphere
with minimal attenuation (unlike conventional radio and TV signals)
don't cope well with solid barriers.  Thus, GPS tends to work poorly
if at all inside buildings.  Tall trees and tall buildings can mess it
up, blocking line of sight to satellites that aren't nearly directly
overhead.</p>

<p>Accuracy also falls off a bit when you're in motion.  This isn't a
physical effect, but mostly due to the fact that computation always
takes a little time; by the time the GPS figures out where you are,
you're not there any more.</p>

<p>Another limit, implicit in the geometry, is that GPS is relatively
poor at getting your precise altitude.  When you can get a signal lock
on four satellites, a modern GPS will give you longitude and latitude
within about 10 meters or yards, down to 2 with DGPS correction.  Vertical 
uncertainty will be much higher, as much as fifty meters.</p>

<p>People who really <a
href="http://www.wsrcc.com/wolfgang/gps/accuracy.html">obsess</a>
about GPS accuracy quote it not as a single figure but as a 
probability-of-error: e.g., you're within 10 meters 95% of the
time and 2 meters 50% of the time.</p>

<p>You can read a more in-depth description of how the satellites and
radio signals work at the <a
href="http://vancouver-webpages.com/pub/peter/gpsfaq.txt">GPS FAQ</a>;
note however that their accuracy estimates are from the Selective
Availability period and expected error has decreased quite a bit
since (the WAAS system they talk about is now generally deployed).</p>

<h1>How GPS Hardware Talks To Computers</h1>

<p>From  a software designer's point of view, a GPS sensor is an
oracle that tells you its location whenever it can get line-of-sight
to four satellites.  Our next topic is how it gets that information
to a computer in a form your application can use.</p>

<p>Almost all GPSes are serial devices that use either RS-232C or USB
to communicate with the host machine.  Most track a standard called 
NMEA 0183 which prescribes both electrical signal levels and a data
encoding.  The protocol is bidirectional, but designed in the expectation
that most of the traffic will be GPS-to-computer, with commands 
going in the computer-to-GPS direction rare.</p>

<p>The modern trend in GPSes is away from RS232C and towards USB.  USB
GPSes keep the NMEA data protocol but discard the NMEA link layer. Under
Linux, USB GPSes use the usbserial module and look like serial ports.
Part of <code>gpsd</code>'s job is to hide this stuff; applications don't have
to be aware of NMEA or the link layer, they just query <code>gpsd</code> for
information.</p>

<h2>The good news about NMEA</h2>

<p>The basic design of the NMEA data protocol is very simple. The GPS
throws ASCII text lines called 'sentences', each beginning with a '$'
and terminated by CR/LF, at the host machine.  Usually the host gets
one update a second, but the GPS has the option of sending more
frequently when it detects a change of position or velocity or status.
The standard prescribes a serial encoding at 4800bps, 8 bits, one stop
bit, no parity.</p>

<p>Here are some sample NMEA sentences:</p>

<listing>
$GPGGA,212734,4740.0569,N,12219.6612,W,1,08,74.00,73.9,M,638.000000,M,,*6D
$GPRMC,212734,A,4740.0569,N,12219.6612,W,0.000000,0.000000,020403,18.936255,E*60
$GPGSA,A,3,17,06,23,15,16,18,10,30,,,,,152.00,74.00,133.00*3F
$GPGGA,212735,4740.0569,N,12219.6612,W,1,08,74.00,74.1,M,638.000000,M,,*63
$GPRMC,212735,A,4740.0569,N,12219.6612,W,0.000000,0.000000,020403,18.936255,E*61
</listing>

<p>Each sentence consists of a comma-separated fields.  The first
field is always a message type and the last a checksum that can be
used to check for data corruption.  Interpreting NMEA sentences is not
complicated.  Modulo a few glitches like 2-digit year numbers, the NMEA
standard does a pretty good job of specifying a message set for GPSes
that want to convey data to computers.</p>

<p>More good news: you should never have to deal with this level
&mdash; <code>gpsd</code>'s purpose is to insulate you from it.</p>

<h2>The bad news about NMEA</h2>

<p>That's the good news.  Now for the bad news, which comes in three
pieces:</p>

<p>First, the NMEA standard does <em>not</em> specify a command
repertoire for the opposite direction.  Thus, functions like changing
the GPS's update frequency or selecting the subset of sentences for it
to send are often not supported at all, and when they are it's all by
sentences that are vendor-specific.</p>

<p>This used to be more of a problem than it is today.  Early GPSes
tended to have elaborate facilities for accepting lists of waypoints
and sending back course information to help you navigate to them.
Modern high-end units still do, but the GPSes designed for connecting
to computers are increasingly designed on the assumption that the host
computer will do all the waypoint geometry itself and the GPSes only
job is to deliver periodic position and velocity readings.  Thus, they
tend to have no control codes at all.  This makes them laudably
stupid.</p>

<p>Second, vendors don't stick to the NMEA-prescribed 4800bps data
rate.  This is understandable; 4800 is very slow by today's standards,
and by boosting bits per second they can deliver information that's
fresher by a few milliseconds (which might make a difference if, say,
you're using a GPS-enabled autopilot to land an aircraft).  Some GPSes
feature data rates upwards of 38400bps. However, this actually does
little good unless the application polls the GPS at a rate faster than
1Hz rather than waiting for it, as most GPS sensors cannot be told to
ship updates faster than once per second &mdash; and the polling
commands (when they exist at all) are proprietary. And the fact that
GPSes don't have a single data rate graven in stone brings back all
the well-known baud-mismatch configuration problems we thought we'd
left behind in the 1980s.</p>

<p>The third problem with NMEA is that it's not universal.  A
decreasing but still significant percentage of GPSes use proprietary
binary protocols.  For example, there was a GPS chipset called
"Zodiac" made by Rockwell International, that used to be very widely
OEMed by GPS makers.  It spoke NMEA, but had irritating limitations in
that mode like not being able to accept DGPS corrections.  It
preferred a tight-packed binary protocol.  There haven't been any new
Zodiac-based designs in a few years, but a lot of Zodiac-based 
GPSes (like the DeLorme EarthMates made before they switched over to a
SiRF chipset in 2003) are still around.</p>

<p>2004's equivalent of the Zodiac is the SiRF-II chipset, which seems
to be nearly ubiquitous in inexpensive GPS sensors.  It too speaks 
a binary protocol, but only if you ask it to; it's fully capable
in NMEA mode. which is where it boots up.  The idea seems to be 
that you can switch to binary to improve your bits-per-second
in latency-critical applications.</p>

<h2>Learning more about NMEA</h2>

<p>The final irritation about NMEA is that it's expensive to buy a
copy.  The National Marine Electronics Association is a trade group of
electronics dealers, and they want <a
href='http://www.nmea.org/pub/0183/'>$250</a> for a copy of their
standard.  Numerous Web sources have reverse-engineered or abstracted
bits of it; the NMEA page piously warns that <q>In most cases they are
very old versions or incorrect interpretations and should not be
depended upon for accuracy,</q> then mutters darkly about copyright
violations.</p>

<p><a href='NMEA.txt'>Here</a> is the best compendium I know of.  I
have never seen a copy of the official NMEA standard.  Fortunately, it
isn't necessary for even <code>gpsd</code> developers to know most of
it, since most modern GPS sensors only emit about a half-dozen of the
eighty or so NMEA sentences.  RMC, GLL, VTG, GGA, GSA, GSV are all you
are ever likely to need to know about, and the only even moderately
tricky bit is that there are two variants of the VTG sentence (grep
for it in the <code>gpsd</code> code if you're really curious).</p>

<p>After you've read about those sentences, it can be instructive to
run <code>gpsd</code> in a mode something like this:</p>

<listing>
./gpsd -N -n -D 2 -p /dev/ttyUSB0
</listing>

<p>Watching the output for thirty seconds or so will give you a good
feel for what your GPS has to say, and how often it says it.</p>

<h1>GPSs and Power Management</h1>

<p>Many GPSes are designed to power down or go to standby mode when
DTR or its USB equivalent goes low (under Linux, this happens when you
close the port).  An important category of exceptions is USB SiRF-II
GPSes; these don't seem to power down on DTR low, but instead go
to a low-power standby mode for the 8/10s of every second that they're
not shipping packets.</p>

<p>Powering down on DTR low can be a valuable power-saving measure if
the GPS is (say) running off of laptop batteries in a navigation or
wardriving system.  Thus, you don't want to keep your GPS device open
when you don't actually need information from it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this rule can collide with one of the persistent
problems with GPSes &mdash; though they can update a previous fix
quickly (in 0.1sec or less), they can take a long time to acquire a
first fix when they power up.</p>

<p>When a GPS receiver boots up, it has to suck radio waves for a
while just to figure out what satellites might be available in line of
sight.  The speed at which it can do this is inversely proportional to
the number of GPS channels it can sample simultaneously.  Older one-
or two-channel units could take several minutes at this.  In 2004,
even low-end GPS sensors have twelve channels and can thus cock a
separate ear for as many satellites as they're ever likely to see.
Even so, it's not uncommon for them to take 30 or 40 seconds after a
cold boot to get a fix.</p>

<p>One of the things <code>gpsd</code> does for applications is handle this
power-management issue.  When no clients are active, <code>gpsd</code> will
automatically close the GPS device, re-opening it only when another
client connects to the daemon.</p>

<h1 id='migrating'>Programming With <code>gpsd</code>-2</h1>

<p>The easiest way to make your program GPS-aware is to link it with
the libgps.a or libgps.so library (and ensure that your host system
starts <code>gpsd</code> at boot time).</p>

<p>There is a limitation in the accuracy of <code>gpsd</code> that
stems from the fact that it waits passively for updates from the
sensor rather than actively polling for them (which can't be done in a
device-independent way).  Most GPSes ship updates just once per
second.  At 50km/h (31mi/h) that's only 13.8 meters change in position
between updates.  This is good enough if you're on foot or in a car
but not good enough for aviation applications,</p>

<p>If you have written a <code>gpsd</code>-aware application, here are
some good functional reasons to migrate to 2.0:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your application can now query whether or not the GPS is online
and get an authoritative answer.</li>

<li>Timestamps are now no longer truncated to seconds, but reported to 
whatever resolution the GPS ships.  Often (notably on SiRF-II GPses)
this is milliseconds.</li>

<li>There is a new "watcher" mode.  It is like raw mode in that the
GPS streams updates at you, but unlike it in that the updates are in 
the simpler GPSD format rather than the more complex NMEA one.</li>

<li>The daemon now automatically tries to reconnect to the GPS once
a second when it is offline but clients are connected.</li>

<li>Writes to clients are nonblocking, so new <code>gpsd</code> cannot
be stalled by a wedged client.</p>
</ol>

<p>These changes mean that even if users casually unplug and reconnect a
GPS, your application can notice the unplug and reconnect events, 
and automatically starts getting data again a second after the reconnect.</p>

<p>The <code>gpsd</code> package provides two ways for C code to get
data from a GPS.  Both go through the libgps.a library, which supports
two sets of entry points. The <a href="libgpsd.html">low-level
interface</a> talks directly to the GPS.  The <a
href="libgps.html">high-level interface</a> communicates with an
instance of <code>gpsd</code>, which uses its own copy of libgps.a to
talk to the device. A third way would be to open a socket to
<code>gpsd</code> and interpret <code>gpsd</code> protocol or raw NMEA
in your application.  Before 2.0, all <code>gpsd</code>-aware
applications had to do this because libgps.a didn't exist.  Now that
it does, the exercise is rather pointless.  Using libgps.a will
probably simplify your code a lot.</p>

<p>You will almost always want to use the high-level interface and go
through the daemon; among other things, this means more than one
application will be able to query the GPS without causing confusion.
The only exception will be in very space-constrained single-user
scenarios, perhaps on embedded systems or PDAs. On those it may be
appropriate to use the low-level interface directly, probably with a
build from source that conditions out all but one of the drivers.</p>

<p>For Python programmers, there are gps.py and gpsd.py modules
implementing respectively the high-level and low-level interfaces.
Each exports a class that encapsulates a GPS session.</p>

<p>There are three minor incompatibilities with <code>gpsd</code> 1.x:</p>

<p>First, <code>gpsd</code>-2's command-line options have been changed
and simplified.  If your <code>gpsd</code>-using application is
starting up <code>gpsd</code> directly you may find you have to modify
the invocation.  However, we don't recommend this.  New
<code>gpsd</code> is designed to be started at boot time and run
continuously just like any normal daemon.  It will do nothing, and be
swapped out, unless there are clients trying to query the GPS.</p>

<p>Second, <code>gpsd</code> now returns "?" as the contents for a 
field when it doesn't have valid data for that field (e.g. latitude 
or longitude before the first fix).  This is only an issue if you are
interpreting GPSD responses yourself rather than using libgps.a or the
gps.py Python module.</p>

<p>Third, the format of the timestamp returned by the D command has
changed, from "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S" to ISO-8601: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ".
No more U.S.-centric date-format assumptions!  Also, as previously
noted, the seconds part may have one or more digits of decimal fractional
seconds.</p>
