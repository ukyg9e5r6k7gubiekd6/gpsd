<abstract>
<para>The NMEA 0183 protocol used by GPS units might best be described as
"layer upon layer of cruft".  In this paper, we examine the problems
and consider a cleaner design.</para>
</abstract>

</articleinfo>

<sect1><title>What's Wrong with NMEA 0183, and Why Fix It?</title>

<para>The protocol used by GPS devices to report to computers is a
small subset of NMEA 0183.  NMEA stands for "National Marine
Electronics Association", and the features GPSes use for reporting
time/position/velocity information are a small part of a protocol
originally designed for communication between parts of complex marine
navigation systems.  Thus the full protocol includes support for depth
sounders, LORAN, and many other things irrelevant to a modern GPS.</para>

<para>The lowest level of NMEA 0183 is quite sensibly designed.  The
protocol consists of sentences, each led by a dollar sign and an
identifying text tag, followed by multiple comma-separated textual
fields, ended by an asterisk, a checksum, and LF/CR.  This is a
simple, clean format with good extensibility, easy to parse and
generate.  It is well adapted to its job, which is to pass
small amounts of numeric and status information.  The textual 
format makes it easy to log NMEA sessions, edit them, and play them
back &mdash; a substantial advantage in developing talker and
parser software.</para>

<para>Unfortunately, the good news ends there.  The design of the
upper layers of NMEA 0183 is patchy, klugey, and replete with the kind
of errors that arise from growth by accretion rather than forethought.
Here are some of the more obvious problems:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> NMEA timestamps usually (e.g in GPBWC, GPBWR, GPGBS,
GPGGA, GPGLL, GPGXA, GPTRF, GPZTG) report time-of-day only.  The
exceptions (GPRMC, GPTRF, GPZDA) report only two digits of year and no
century.  Time precision is unspecified, usually to the second though
some devices report a fractional decimal part to millisecond
precision.  </para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
It is not possible to get a time/position/velocity report in a single
sentence.  Some sentences (GPRMC) report time and 2D position and velocity, 
some (GPGGA) report time and 3D position, some (GPVTG) report velocity
only.  As a result, the API for a protocol client is complicated by
the necessity of maintaining separate age indications for 2D position,
3D position, and velocity,
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
NMEA sentences have at least three kinds of validity indicators &mdash; mode
(GPGSA only), status (GPGLL, GPGGA), and the Active/Void field (GPRMC,
GPGLL).  And that's before we get into the FAA extensions in late
revisions of the protocol.  Interpreting these status bits is a black
art involving knowledge of undocumented and often vendor-specific quirks.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
There is no standard way of indicating that part of a
time/position/velocity report is invalid (e.g. because the device does
not have a fix of the required quality).  Many devices simply report 0
for invalid fields, which doesn't sound bad unless you're near the
zero-zero point in the Bay of Benin &mdash; or at sea level.  It is
also not generally possible to distinguish between information a GPS
is not yet reporting but will return on a good fix (such as altitude)
from information it will never report (such as, on many units, local
magnetic variation).  </para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
As least one messy bit in NMEA 0183 was an adaptation to machines with
only small amounts of expensive RAM: the fact that satellite status
may show up in a sequence of as many as three sentences to be
processed serially.  On modern machines, RAM buffers are cheap.  It
makes more sense to ship a single long sentence and decrease code
complexity in the receiver by not requiring a stateful parser.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Position accuracy estimates are not easy to compute from
NMEA reports.  Reporting a measurement without giving its 95% 
confidence interval is bad practice.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
For modern GPS devices, even the small piece of NMEA directly
concerned with GPS capabilities is seriously over-complex.  Whereas
older GPS devices included elaborate facilities for waypoint tracking
and navigational computation, newer ones are designed under the
assumption that they are connected to a general-purpose computer that
is more powerful and flexible at these things; thus, the GPS only
needs to be a time/position/velocity oracle.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> 
NMEA 0183 is in general very loosely specified and
poorly documented. Its problems are compounded by the fact that it is
a proprietary specification, jealously guarded by IP lawyers.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>As a result of these problems, implementing NMEA 0183 talker
software is far more complex than need be, and the protocol tends to
introduce latencies that vary in an unpredictable way.  The latter is
a serious problem for aviation and other high-precision GPS
applications, and probably provided a technical reason for the one major GPS
vendor (Garmin) has announced that it will drop NMEA 0183 support
entirely in favor of a tighter binary protocol (we refrain from
speculating on other less creditable motives for this move).</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>How To Do Better</title>

<para>The critique above immediately suggests several ways to improve
a protocol for GPS reports;</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
Keep the low-level syntax, because it's not broken.  It has all the
advantages of textual protocols.  Going to a more tightly-packed
binary format might look attractive at first glance, but the gain in
information would be marginal at best. Textual formats already use 
7 out of 8 bits per byte and encode variable-length numeric fields more 
efficiently than binary; also they avoid endianness issues.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> 
Add to the syntax standard ways of indicating that either (a) the
GPS cannot now ship valid data for the field, or (b) the GPS will 
<emphasis>never</emphasis> ship data for this field.
</para></listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Include a full timestamp, to millisecond precision or better, with
every sentence.  Every timestamp should be in the same standard form
and should include a full date.</para>

<para>The simplest way to do this is probably the best.  Just pick an
epoch and represent the date/time as seconds since the epoch GMT. A
human-readable format like ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sss) might 
make logfiles slightly easier to read, but would introduce more 
decode latency.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para> 
Report the uncertainty corresponding to a 95% confidence interval for
each measurement field.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Design the protocol around a single core sentence that reports
time/position/velocity and the uncertainties in same.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Make it an objective of the design for an informal specification to fit 
on a single page.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Informal specification: SGPS</title>

<para>Here, then, is a proposed informal specification for SGPS, Simple GPS
Protocol.</para>

<para>The protocol consists of sentences, each led by a dollar sign
and an identifying sentence tag, followed by multiple comma-separated
textual fields, ended by an asterisk, a CRC36 checksum, and LF/CR.
The terminating checksum may be omitted, and listeners should accept
this as an indication that the talker believes the transport layer to
be reliable.  Sentences are at most 256 characters long, counting the
trailing CR/LF.</para>

<para>A field that is empty indicates that the talker does not have 
valid information for this field.  A field consisting of a question
mark (?) indicates that the talker will never ship valid information
for this field.</para>

<para>The first field of every sentence is a full timestamp.  We
choose an epoch of 00:00 Jan 1 1970 because it's no worse than any
other recent date and has the advantage of being compatible with Linux
and Unix systems.  Millisecond or better precision is required and
time is Zulu or GMT.</para>

<para>The core sentence of SGPS has the following layout:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
The sentence tag is GPTPV, standing for Time/Position/Velocity.  
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The first field is the required timestamp.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The second field is the uncertainty of the timestamp in microseconds.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The third field is latitude in degrees.  It must be suffixed with one
of 'N' for North or 'S' for South.  Encoding must be decimal
degrees, not degree/minute/second.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The fourth field is longitude in degrees.  It must be suffixed with one
of 'E' for East or 'W' for West. Encoding must be decimal
degrees, not degree/minute/second.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The fifth field is horizontal uncertainty in meters (95% confidence).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The sixth field is altitude in meters.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The seventh field is vertical uncertainty in meters (95% confidence).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The eighth field is speed in meters per second.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The ninth field is speed uncertainty in meters per second (95% confidence).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The tenth field is course over ground in degrees from true north.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The eleventh field is uncertainty of course over ground in degrees  (95% 
confidence).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The twelfth field is vertical course angle in degrees from horizontal.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The thirteenth field is uncertainty of vertical course angle in degrees
(95% confidence).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The fourteenth field is an FAA mode indicator.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>These fourteen fields completely describe the position and
velocity of an object and the associated uncertainties.  The FAA
mode field is added to satisfy a U.S. regulator's requirement.</para>

                         Checksum omitted.

<para>A second sentence describes GPS satellite status.</para>

<listitem><para>

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The second field is a count of satellites.
</para></listitem>

<listitem>
<para>The remainder of the sentence fields are groups of four, one
for each predicted position of a visible satellite. Each group has
the following four elements:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
The PRN or satellite ID.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Elevation in degrees
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

<listitem><para>
Signal-to-noise ratio in decibels.  If this satellite was used in the
last fix, suffix this field with a '!'.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Here is an example:</para>

<programlisting>
$GPSVU,11,03,03,111,00,04,15,270,00,06,01,010,00,13,06,292,00,14,25,170,00,16,57,208,39!,18,67,296,40!,19,40,246,00,22,42,067,42,24,14,311,43!,27,05,244,00

<sect1><title>Could This Be Adopted?</title>

<para>Astute readers will already have noted that the SGPS sentences
might be sold as a minor extension to NMEA 0183. first supplementing
and eventually obsolescing the half-dozen or so sentences emitted by 
most modern GPSes.</para>

<para>The only fields reported in the SGPS set that cannot be
trivially derived from data already computed for NMEA reports are
(a) Vertical course angle, and (b) GPSTPV uncertainty fields.  None
of these should be difficult to derive.</para>
