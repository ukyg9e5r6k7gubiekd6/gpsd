# This file describes the network of gpsd test sites
# These are accounts in machines made available
# for regression-testing by GPSD developers.
#
#  For instructions on joining and using this network, see the file
# 'flock-instructions'.
#
# In the default section of the file, the attributes are:
# project - project name at CIA.vc
# origin = URL for repo pulls
# regression = test sequence to run
# sshkeys = path to file of user keys
#
[DEFAULT]
project = GPSD
origin = git://git.berlios.de/gpsd
regression = ./autogen.sh && make && make clean && make check
#
# In each site section, the section name is the FQDN of the host machine.  
# The attributes are:
#
# arch: Architecture tag - i686, x96_64, sparc64, etc. = `uname -m`
# os: Operating system = `uname -s`
# admin: Email address of machine administrator
# login: Login name of test account
# devices: Comma-separated list of attached GPS/AIS receivers, or '-' for none.
# status = anything other than "up" causes this entry to be skipped.
