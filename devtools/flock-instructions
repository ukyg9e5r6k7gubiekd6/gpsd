The gpsd test flock is intended to make it easy for GPSD devs to
verify operation of the software on multiple architectures and operating
systems.

To add a machine to the flock, do these steps:

1. Create a test-sandbox account. The recommended name is "gpsd".

2. Install git and gpsd's build prerequisites (gcc, Python, autotools, etc.)
   where the test account can run them.  On a Debian/Ubuntu system you may be
   able to do this all at once with this command:

   aptitude install git-core; aptitude build-dep gpsd

3. Make sure the account is reachable from the general Internet via ssh.

4. Install the public key of the test-network gatekeeper in 
   .ssh/authorized_keys.  Presently the test-network gatekeeper is
   esr@thyrsus.com; it is expected that this role will be held by the
   GPSD project lead or some delegate.  The key is:

ssh-dss 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 esr@snark

5. Append an entry to the flock-sites file and push to origin with the commit
   message "Added new flock site" or something similar.  If you do not
   have git commit access, mail the entry to the development mailing
   list.

To gain access to the test network:

1. Email a valid public ssh key to the gatekeeper. He will install the
   key on the test sites.

To use the test network:

1. Call the script 'flocktest', giving it your email address as argument.
   (You can also set your email name in a .flockdriver dot file; do
   "flocktest -?" to see instructions about how to set this up.)

   The local flocktest script will execute the remote flockdriver
   script on each machine, calling it with your email name as
   argument. See the local copy of the flockdriver script for
   details on the test sequence
