This is a list of developer tools included in the SVN source tarball
but not necessarily shipped in the tarball or binary distributions If you're
viewing it with Emacs, you can try doing Ctl-C Ctl-t browse through
the outline headers.  Ctl-C Ctl-a will unfold them again.

** ais.py

AIS packet decoder in Python.  Useful as a check on the C code.

** aidvmtable

Generate an asciidoc table of the six-bit encoding used in AIVDM packets.

** cycle_analyzer

Finds end-of-cycle sentences from GPS output logs.

** editcomment

Edit the change comment at the revision level specified as $1.
Only works if you have developer ssh access to the repo.

** fakecompare

Compare the results from running gpsfake on a logfile between this
machine and a remote one.  Especially useful when remote and local
have different word lengths.

** findbreakage

Starting from a specified SVN revision number, this Python program runs 
regression tests forward until something fails.  It uses a binary search, so
convergence should be very rapid.

** leapsecond.py

Gets the current leap-second correction forom IERS and/or the USNO.

** logextract

Extract pure NMEA from an emailed gpsd error log. The output can be fed 
to gpsfake.

** maskaudit

# Report on which status masks are used in the daemon vs. the client-side
# library.

** regress-builder

This script runs an exhaustive test on combinations of compilation options, 
looking for ones that break the build.

** regressdiff

Walk through a pair of textfiles looking for where they begin to differ.
May be useful for comparing logs when regression tests break.

** striplog

Strip leading comment lines from NMEA sentence logs.  gpsfake can do
this itself now, so this script has a lot of dust on it.
