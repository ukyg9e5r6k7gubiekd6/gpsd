etc_default_gpsd  and etc_init.d_gpsd are Debian init files to be
used when it is desired to support gpsd using a set of serial GPSes.

The following tools are not production-ready. They are included only as
conveniences, examples or rudimetary starting points for other development
efforts.

binlog and binreplay are probably only useful for people developing
new protocols, when gpsfake does not yet know what to do with a log
file. These utilities are not particularly clever - they merely slurp
a tty's output into a file, or spray the contents of a file out of a
tty.

nmeasend is probably only useful to people developing new protocols
or testing odd features of their hardware. it takes the body of an
NMEA sentence (without the $ or the *checksum) and ships a properly
formatted NMEA sentence to the specified tty.

sirfctl might be used to reset an uncooperative sirfstar receiver to
a usable state. For whatever reason sometimes they do not respond to
a protocol switch command; this spams the receiver with configuration
commands, and hopefully it listens. This works at least as well as
the official SiRF tools.

skyview.php is used to generate pictures of your skyview, and may be
used to help determine if a given antenna placement is appropriate for
some purpose. This tool requires about 24hrs worth of "Y" messages and
outputs an image of accumulated SV position and signal strength. It is
sometimes entertaining to "see" occulted SVs using multipath. You must
have the PHP-GD installed to use this script.

ashctl is like nmeasend or sirfctl, but for Ashtech receivers.

ubxsend is like nmeasend or sirfctl, but for u-blox receivers.

motosend is like nmeasend or sirfctl, but for receivers that use the motorola
protocol (like motorola oncore or rockwell jupiter). it's a little buggy with
syncing up to the start of a packet, but it'll send control strings OK.

maxsats.pl analyzes a collection of "Y" messages and outputs records
describing periods of excellent visibility (ie. 10 or more PRNs tracked).
With over 30 SVs on orbit, there are periods where 14 PRNs are above the
horizon, 13 are tracking, and at least 12 are actually used in a solution.
