.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.SS "xgps"

.PP
xgps is a simple test client for gpsd with an X interface\&. It displays current GPS position/time/velocity information and (for GPSes that support the feature) the locations of accessible satellites\&.

.PP
xgps accepts an \-h option as for gpsd, or a \-V option to dump the package version and exit\&.

.PP
An optional argument may specify a server to get data from; a colon\-separated suffix is taken as a port number\&. If there is a second colon\-separated suffix, that is taken as a device name to be handed to the daemon in an F= command\&.

.PP
The \fB\-speedunits\fR option can be used to set the speed units for display; follow the keyword with knots for nautical miles per hour, kph for kilometres per hour, or mph for miles per hour\&. The default is miles per hour\&. This option can also be set as the X resource 'speedunits'\&.

.PP
The \fB\-altunits\fR option can be used to set the altitude units for display; follow the keyword with 'meters' or 'feet'\&. The default is feet\&. This option can also be set as the X resource 'altunits'\&.

.PP
The \fB\-l\fR option sets the format of latitude and longitude reports\&. The value 'd' produces decimal degrees and is the default\&. The value 'm' produces degrees and decimal minutes\&. The value 's' produces degrees, minutes, and decimal seconds\&.

.PP
The \fB\-s\fR option sets the number of received sentences to process after any fix is received before blanking any field\&. By default it is set to 4, which prevents annoying display flicker on NMEA devices that send several difference sentence types per update cycle, only one of which is a true fix\&. Set this option to zero to disable smoothing and see each update exactly as it is sent\&.

.PP
There is a known bug in xgps; it assumes the default font size is no more than 18 pixels\&. If this is not the case, the satellite data display will show fewer than 12 satellites\&.

.SS "xgpsspeed"

.PP
xgpsspeed is a speedometer that uses position information from the GPS\&. It accepts an \-h option and optional argument as for gps, or a \-V option to dump the package version and exit\&. Additionally, it accepts \-rv (reverse video) and \-nc (needle color) options\&.

.PP
The \-speedunits option can be used to set the speed units for display; follow the keyword with knots for nautical miles per hour, kph for kilometres per hour, or mph for miles per hour\&. The default is miles per hour\&. This option can also be set as the X resource 'speedunits'\&.

.SS "cgps"

.PP
cgps is a client resembling xgps, but without the pictorial satellite display and able to run on a serial terminal or terminal emulator\&.

.PP
The \fB\-s\fR option prevents cgps from printing the raw data\&. This display can also be toggled with the s command\&.

.PP
Rather than use X resources to determine which units to use, cgps looks at variables in its environment\&. Here are the variables and values it checks:

.IP

    GPSD_UNITS one of: 
              imperial   = miles/feet
              nautical   = knots/feet
              metric     = km/meters
    LC_MEASUREMENT
	      en_US      = miles/feet
              C          = miles/feet
              POSIX      = miles/feet
              [other]    = km/meters
    LANG
	      en_US      = miles/feet
              C          = miles/feet
              POSIX      = miles/feet
              [other]    = km/meters

.PP
cgps terminates when you send it a SIGHUP or SIGINT; given default terminal settings this will happen when you type Ctl\-C at it\&. It will also terminate on 'q'

.SS "cgpxlogger"

.PP
This program connects to gpsd, polls for location, and logs each fix to standard output in GPX (XML) format\&.

.PP
The program also writes start and end messages to syslog\&.

.SS "gpxlogger"

.PP
This program listens to DBUS broadcasts from gpsd (org\&.gpsd\&.fix) and logs each fix to standard output as they arrive in an XML format\&.

.PP
The output may be composed of multiple tracks\&. A new track is created if there's no fix for 5 seconds\&.

.PP
The program also writes start and end messages to syslog\&.
