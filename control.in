Package: gpsd

Description: A monitoring daemon for GPSes, AIS radios, and other nav sensors.
 gpsd is a userland daemon acting as a translator between GPS and
 AIS receivers and their clients. gpsd listens on port 2947 for clients
 requesting position/time/velocity information.  The receivers are
 expected to generate position information in a well-known format -- as
 NMEA-0183 sentences, SiRF binary, Rockwell binary, Garmin binary
 format, or other vendor binary protocols.  gpsd takes this
 information from the GPS and translates it into JSON objects in a uniform
 and well-documented format that easier for clients to understand.  The
 distribution includes sample clients, application interface libraries,
 and test/profiling tools.
