# GPS capability description file
#
# Our apologies to all Unix hackers in advance for the grubby .INI syntax,
# we're using it because the format has good cross-Unix support in Python.
#
# Each section may have the following capabilities
#
# type	       = "engine", "vendor", or "device"
# date         = date of submission
# submitter    = email of submitter, name may need quoting for RFC822
# description  = Human-readable description of this item
# packaging    = A device's form factor
# techdoc      = URL to technical documentation, or at least a spec sheet
# vendor_site  = URL of a vendor site
# vendor       = vendor name
# eval_unit    = Which GPSD devs have one for testing (list)
# engine       = GPS chipset (may reference another section)
# subtype      = engine subtype or firmware revision level
# interfaces   = interface types: USB, RS232, Bluetooth, CF, TTL. May be a list.
# usbchip      = USB I/O chipset
# pps	       = supports pulse-per-second precision time reporting
# noconfigure  = can be bricked by baud-rate changes (requires -b option)
# tested       = last gpsd tested, or "regression" if we have a test load
# nmea	       = NMEA version this emits, if known
# notes	       = Miscellaneous notes on this item.  To be interpreted as HTML.
# rating       = excellent, good, fair, poor, broken, other
# discontinued = If present, product has been discontinued
#
# Capability strings:
#
# to_nmea     = if present, how to switch to NMEA 0183 mode from native binary
# to_native   = if present, how to swith to native binary mode from NMEA
# modeset     = set protocol, baud rate, 8N1
#
# Inheritance
#
# To inherit capabilities from a specified section, name the section in
# a "uses =" attribute. Use chains are followed recursively.  An attribute
# in a section overrides all attributes of the same name in all ancestor
# sections.
#
# Certain escapes in capability strings are translated:
#
# %b	- baud rate as ASCII numeral
#
# A string beginning with 0x is interpreted as a sequence of paired hex bytes,
# leading 0x not included.
#
# Comment lines led with "#%" are vendor section marks to be used when
# generating an HTML table from this file.  Each should consist of a vendor
# name.
#
# Further notes:
# * In the packaging feld, a "GPS mouse" is a standalone sensor in a
#   display-less case designed be used as an outbard peripheral.  An
#   "OEM module" is an un-cased circuit board with edge connectors; a
#   "chipset" is what it sounds like.
#   A "handset" is a standalone GPS with a display and human-usable
#   controls. A "handsfree" is a hands-free unit with display designed for 
#   mounting on a car windshield or boat dash.
# * In the rating field:
#    "excellent" - gpsd recognizes the GPS rapidly and reliably,
#		  reports are complete and correct.
#    "good" -- gpsd has minor problems or lag recognizing the device,
#	      but reports are complete and correct.
#    "fair" -- Reports have minor dropouts or problems, including occasional
#	      transient nonsense values.
#    "poor" -- Reports frequently have values that are wrong or nonsense.
#    "broken" -- gpsd frequently fails to recognize the device at all.
#    "other -- See Technical Notes.

      and TripNav logs in NMEA. NMEA starts with GGA and ends with RMC. The

notes = This is a GPS data logger with mouse functionality. Before it can be
      used with gpsd, the mouse functionality has to be switched on. That
      can be done with the rgm3800py utility by Karsten Petersen. The author of
      said tool has been very helpful to me by describing how to do that on
      the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rgm3800py/wiki/GPSd">
      projectpage</a>. Basically, one needs to run "rgm3800.py -d
      /dev/ttyUSB0 gmouse on" before starting gpsd.

notes = OEM module, available in small quantities from Tri-M
      systems. The ANTARIS chipset is obsolete, replaced by
      ANTARIS4. This module works in NMEA mode; gpsd also supports the
      UBX binary protocol. Firmware updates are available from uBlox;
      the update is strongly recommended as it fixes a number of UBX
      bugs, and adds useful new features.

submitter = Reported by Ian Darwin <ian@darwinsys.com>
notes = This receiver operates as a generic NMEA device, the Sony
      binary protocol is unsupported. The receiver seems to lock up if
      too much data is thrown at it (ie. gpsd probes) thus it may
      require a read-only (-b) instance of gpsd. (We say 'may' because
      more recent instances of gpsd break the probe writes into pieces
      interleaved with read, and may no longer trigger this problem)
