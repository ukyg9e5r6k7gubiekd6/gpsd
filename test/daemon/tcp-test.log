# Notes: The most significant thing about this test load is not the content,
#        but the magic cookie that tells it to feed the daemon over TCP
#        rather than a pseudo-tty. We include spme leading garbage as a
#        robustness check for the packetizer.  There is a UDP test load 
#        that feeds the same content.
