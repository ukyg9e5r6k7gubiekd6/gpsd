These are data logs from various weird GPSes.  Use them to test
assumptions about NMEA formats and cycle regularities, or as 
regression-test loads for gpsfake -p.

Structured headers are as follows:

# Name: Product name
# Chipset: chipset name and (if possible) firmware revision level.
# Description: product description (optional)
# Cycle time: time to repeat a sentence in seconds
# Start-of-cycle: sentence that begins each cycle
# Pause-noted: did submitter note the intercycle pause? (Y/N)
# Well-behaved: Timestamps are constant across cycle (Y/N)
# Submitted-by: who sent it
# Date: when it was received
# Location: city, state/province, country, approximate lat/lon
