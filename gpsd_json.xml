<refsect1 id='overview'><title>OVERVIEW</title>

<para><application>gpsd</application> is a service daemon that can be used
to monitor GPSes, DGPS receivers, Marine AIS broadcasts, and various other
location-related and kinematic sensors.</para>

<para>Clients may communicate with <application>gpsd</application> via
textual requests and responses over a socket. It is a bad idea for
applications to speak the protocol directly: rather, they should use
the <application>libgps</application> client library (for C; bindings
also exist for other languages) and take appropriate care to
conditionalize their code on the major and minor protocol version
symbols.</para>

<para>The GPSD protocol is built on top of JSON, JavaScript
Object Notation. GPSD's use of JSON is restricted in some ways
that make parsing it in fixed-extent languages (such as C) easier.</para>

<para>A request line is introduced by "?" and may include multiple
commands.  Commands begin with a command identifier, followed either
by a terminating ';' or by an equal sign "=" and a JSON object treated
as an argument.  Any ';' or newline indication (either LF or CR-LF)
after the end of a command is ignored. All request lines must be
composed of US-ASCII characters and may be no more than 80 characters
in length, exclusive of the trailing newline.</para>

<para>Responses are JSON objects all of which have a "class" attribute
the value of which is either the name of the invoking command.  There
are reports (including but not limited to as "TPV", "SKY", "DEVICE",
and "ERROR") which are not direct responses to commands.</para>

<para> The order of JSON attributes within a response object is never
significant, and you may specify attributes in commands in any
order. Responses never contain the special JSON value null; instead,
attributes with empty or undefined values are omitted. The length
limit for responses and reports is 1536 characters, including trailing
newline; longer responses will be truncated, so client code must be
prepared for the possibility of invalid JSON fragments.</para>

<para>In JSON reports, if an attribute is present only if the parent 
attribute is present or has a particular range, then the parent
attribute is emitted first.</para>

<para>There is one constraint on the order in which attributes will
be omitted. If an optional attribute is present only when a parent
attribute has a specified value or range of values, the parent
attribute will be emitted first to make parsing easier.</para>

<para>The next subsection section documents the core GPSD protocol.
Extensions are documented in the following subsections. The extensions
may not be supported in your <application>gpsd</application> instance
if it has been compiled with a restricted feature set.</para>

<term>TPV</term>
<listitem>
<para>A TPV object is a time-position-velocity report. The "class" and "mode"
fields will reliably be present. The "mode" field will be emitted
before optional fields that may be absent when there is no fix. Error
estimates will be emitted after the fix components they're associated with.
Others may be reported or not depending on the fix quality.</para>

<para>Many devices compute dilution of precision factors but do not
include them in their reports.  Many that do report DOPs report only
HDOP, two-dimensional circular error. <application>gpsd</application>
always passes through whatever the device actually reports, then
attempts to fill in other DOPs by calculating the appropriate
determinants in a covariance matrix based on the satellite view. DOPs
may be missing if some of these determinants are singular. It can even
happen that the device reports an error estimate in meters when the
corresponding DOP is unavailable; some devices use more sophisticated
error modeling than the covariance calculation.</para>

<para>This message is emitted once per second to watchers of a device
emitting PPS, and is intended to report the drift between the start of
the GPS second and seconds as reported by the system clock (which may
be NTP-corrected).</para>

<para>The message contains second/microsecond pairs for two clocks;
the realtime clock without NTP correction (the result of 
clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME), but only to microsecond precision) 
and the ordinary system clock (which may be NTP corrected).</para>

<para>There are various sources of error in the reported clock times.
For PPS delivered via a real serial-line strobe, serial-interrupt
latency plus processing time to the timer call should be bounded above
by about 10 microseconds; USB-to-serial control-line emulation is
known to add jitter of about 50 microseconds.  (Both figures are for
GPSD running in non-realtime mode on an x86 with a gigahertz clock and
are estimates based on measured latency in other applications)</para>

<listitem>

<para>This command reports (when followed by ';') the state of a
device, or sets (when followed by '=' and a DEVICE object)
device-specific control bits, notably the device's speed and serial
mode and the native-mode bit.  The parameter-setting form will be rejected if
more than one client is attached to the channel.</para>

<para>Pay attention to the response, because it is
possible for this command to fail if the GPS does not support a
speed-switching command or only supports some combinations of
serial modes.  In case of failure, the daemon and GPS will
continue to communicate at the old speed.</para>

<para>Use the parameter-setting form with caution.  On USB and
Bluetooth GPSes it is also possible for serial mode setting to fail
either because the serial adaptor chip does not support non-8N1 modes
or because the device firmware does not properly synchronize the
serial adaptor chip with the UART on the GPS chipset when the speed
changes. These failures can hang your device, possibly requiring a GPS
power cycle or (in extreme cases) physically disconnecting the NVRAM
backup battery.</para>

<refsect1 id='rtcm2'><title>RTCM2</title>

<para>RTCM-104 is a family of serial protocols used for broadcasting pseudorange
corrections from differential-GPS reference stations. Many GPS receivers can
accept these corrections to improve their reporting accuracy.</para>

<para>RTCM-104 comes in two major and incompatible flavors, 2.x and
3.x.  Each major flavor has minor (compatible) revisions.</para>

<para>The applicable standard for RTCM Version 2.x is <citetitle>RTCM
Recommended Standards for Differential NAVSTAR GPS Service</citetitle>
RTCM Paper 194-93/SC 104-STD. For RTCM 3.1 it is <citetitle>RTCM Paper
177-2006-SC104-STD</citetitle>.  Ordering instructions for both
standards are accessible from the website of the <ulink
url='http://www.rtcm.org/'>Radio Technical Commission for Maritime
Services</ulink> under "Publications".</para>

<refsect2 id='wire-format'><title>RTCM WIRE TRANSMISSIONS</title>

<para>Differential-GPS correction stations consist of a GPS reference
receiver coupled to a low frequency (LF) transmitter.  The GPS
reference receiver is a survey-grade GPS that does GPS carrier
tracking and can work out its own position to a few millimeters.  It
generates range and range-rate corrections and encodes them into
RTCM104. It ships the RTCM104 to the LF transmitter over serial rs-232
signal at 100 baud or 200 baud depending on the requirements of the
transmitter.</para>

<para>The LF transmitter broadcasts the approximately 300khz radio
signal that differential-GPS radio receivers pick up.  Transmitters
that are meant to have a higher range will need to transmit at the
slower rate.  The higher the data rate the harder it will be for the
remote radio receiver to receive with a good signal-to-noise ration.
(Higher data rate signals can't be averaged over as long a time frame,
hence they appear noisier.)</para>

</refsect2>
<refsect2 id='rtcm-wire-format'><title>RTCM WIRE FORMATS</title>

<para>An RTCM 2.x message consists of a sequence of up to 33 30-bit
words. The 24 most significant bits of each word are data and the six
least significant bits are parity. The parity algorithm used is the
same ISGPS-2000 as that used on GPS satellite downlinks.  Each RTCM
2.x message consists of two header words followed by zero or more data
words, depending upon message type.</para>

<para>An RTCM 3.x message begins with a fixed leader byte 0xD3.  That
is followed by six bits of version information and 10 bits of payload
length information.  Following that is the payload; following the
payload is a 3-byte checksum of the payload using the Qualcomm CRC-24Q
algorithm.</para>

</refsect2>
<refsect2 id='rtcm2-dump-format2'><title>RTCM2 JSON FORMAT</title>

<para>Each RTCM2 message is dumped as a single JSON object per
message, with the message fields as attributes of that object.  Arrays
of satellite, station, and constellation statistics become arrays of
JSON sub-objects. Each sentence will normally also have a "device"
field containing the pathname of the originating device.</para>

attributes are emitted before others.</para>

<refsect1 id='dump-format3'><title>RTCM3 DUMP FORMAT</title>

<para>The support for RTCM104v3 dumping is incomplete and buggy.  Do not
attempt to use it for production! Anyone interested in it should read
the source code.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='ais'><title>AIS DUMP FORMATS</title>

<para>AIS support is an extension.  It may not be present if your
instance of <application>gpsd</application> has been built with
a restricted feature set.</para>

<para>AIS packets are dumped as JSON objects with class "AIS".  Each
AIS report object contains a "type" field giving the AIS message type
and a "scaled" field telling whether the remainder of the fields are
dumped in scaled or unscaled form. (These will be emitted before any
type-specific fields.) It will also contain a "device" field naming
the data source.  Other fields have names and types as specified in
the <citetitle>AIVDM/AIVDO Protocol Decoding</citetitle> document on
the GPSD project website; each message field table may be directly
interpreted as a specification for the members of the corresponding
JSON object type.</para>

<para>By default, certain scaling and conversion operations are
performed for JSON output.  Latitudes and longitudes are scaled to
decimal degrees rather than the native AIS unit of 1/10000th of a
minute of arc.  Ship (but not air) speeds are scaled to knots rather
than tenth-of-knot units.  Navigation status and positioning-system
type are dumped as text strings rather than AIS numeric codes. Rate of
turn may appear as "nan" if is unavailable, or as one of the strings
"fastright" or "fastleft" if it is out of the AIS encoding range;
otherwise it is quadratically mapped back to the turn sensor number in
degrees per minute. Vessel draughts are converted to decimal meters
rather than native AIS decimeters. Various other scaling conversions
are described in <citetitle>"AIVDM/AIVDO Protocol Decoding"</citetitle>.</para>

</refsect1>
<refsect1 id='subframe'><title>SUBFRAME DUMP FORMATS</title>

<para>Subframe support is always compiled into
<application>gpsd</application> but many GPS do not output Subframe data
or the <application>gpsd</application> driver may not support Subframes.
</para>

<para>Subframe packets are dumped as JSON objects with class "SUBFRAME".
Each Subframe report object contains a "frame" field giving the subframe
number, a "tSV" field for the transmitting satellite number, a "TOW17"
field containing the 17 MSBs of the start of the next 12-second message
and a "scaled" field telling whether the remainder of the fields are
dumped in scaled or unscaled form. It will also contain a "device" field
naming the data source.  Each SUBFRAME object will have a sub-object
specific to that subframe page type.  Those sub-object fields have names
and types similar to those specified in the IS-GPS-200E document; each
message field table may be directly interpreted as a specification for
the members of the corresponding JSON object type.</para>
